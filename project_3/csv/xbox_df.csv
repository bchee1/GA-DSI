"I said ""fuck it"" and pulled the trigger on a one X today.","I have mainly gamed on a Switch and 3DS for the last few years. I had a ps4 but I honestly hate Sony's business ethics and I felt no connection to the first party games besides God of War. I wanted a newer system come next month. Me and my wife were able to secure a ps5 for my son and I was left in the dust. I couldn't get a hold of an Xbox series S or X, and no ps5.  I felt stupid for calling stores asking if they had any pre-orders left and when I was laughed at during a call it really sucked. 

I hate having a 1080p console on a 4k tv. It looks awful and unnatural. I wanted a new system that could hit true 4K. Sony's fake checkerboard crap wasn't going to cut it. I got a refurbished xbox one X with a one year warranty for $280. I figured that since Xbox was behind on 1st party support right now this could give me the time to play games like Far Cry 5 before jumping to the new gen. At least two years.

So I am now on the Microsoft band wagon and I hope I am very impressed when this thing comes on on the 7th. Any recommendations from you guys?",t2_87xipzu4

Please play Outer Wilds,"Not to be confused with Outer Worlds, Outer Wilds is not an obscure game but also not very well known due to it being an indie title. It’s on game pass and was my favorite game of last year, Sekiro being the second (great game btw). It’s a single player space exploration game with an amazing narrative, soundtrack, and overall message. I won’t go too far into it as it’s best to go in blind with this game; but please, don’t research it, just download it on game pass and play it. You won’t regret it",t2_5srmmv37
Xbox Series X seems to be outselling Playstation 5 in Brazil,"
The pre orders for XSX and XSS only started yesterday (Sep-29) in Brazil. PS5 pre orders, on the other hand, started at the same world-wide date (Sep-17) here.

After 12 days PS5s are not sold out yet in any of the top 3 national retailers. And several retailers are now giving 5-10% discounts. [ps5_link](https://www.americanas.com.br/produto/1838061077/console-playstation-5-ps5), [ps5_link2](https://m.pontofrio.com.br/console-playstation-5-controle-sem-fio-dualsense-55010438.html)

About 24 hours after launch, XSX sold out in 2 of those 3 largest retailers. [xsx_link1](https://www.americanas.com.br/produto/2116373642/console-xbox-series-x-1tb), [xsx_link2](https://m.pontofrio.com.br/console-xbox-series-x-1tb-controle-sem-fio-preto-55014095.html) 

Amazon (which is new in the country) still have XSXs available, and lists XSX and XSS as the 2 best selling items in its ""Games and Consoles"" category, with the PS5 in 4th position. [amazon_rank_link](https://www.amazon.com.br/gp/bestsellers/videogames/ref=zg_b_bs_videogames_1) [amazon_screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/CatWeDO)

PS.: Before you envy us for still being able to buy both consoles on launch day, take into consideration the fact we have one  of the “world’s most expensive consoles”, at R$4.999, which is close to double the $499 US price, due to insane import taxes. Most Brazilians will end up buying those consoles in the grey market after launch, imported through Paraguai or the US.",t2_22v2khqj

So as I was cleaning out my xbox one, I accidentally broke of the connector that  the front ribbon cable connects to on the front panel board. Instead of changing out the hole front panel board, do you think I could just solder on a new connector for the ribbon cable?

Xbox Game Pass needs more new sport games to become the complete package,"Game Pass is starting to become an absolute force for gaming. It is adding games that I never thought would be added to a service like this, at least at this point in time. Easily the best deal in gaming. However, there are a lot of gamers that primarily play sports games (NBA 2k, madden, Fifa, NHL, etc) and this really is a portion of the market that game pass hasn't hit yet.  Adding EA access is a great start. A lot of the older games will now be available, but how about those that want to play newer sports games?


At first I thought this was unlikely purely due to the fact that so many people buy these games already, what incentive is there to add them. However, most of these games are now so micro transaction heavy (which I hate) that I could see them putting the game on gamepass to get more traffic through the game and therefore more microtransactions.


Overall, one of the few genre's that is really underrepresented on game pass are sports titles, and bringing the new 2k, madden, Fifa, etc to the service would cement it as a must have in just about every gamer's household. Hopefully these games aren't neglected from the plans for the future of game pass.",t2_7ti6w

Atmos vs. Standard DD 5.1,"I recently got an audio setup that supports Dolby Atmos, so I was excited to test it out (I know only a select list of games have Atmos support).

What I’ve noticed is when I set the audio output to Atmos in the system settings, for SOME games that don’t support Atmos, this actually results in no longer getting 5.1 surround at all (meaning no sounds from rear channels).  I have to manually go back and switch the settings to regular DD 5.1 for some games to get 5.1 surround.

I was under the impression that even if a game doesn’t support Atmos, as long as it supports regular DD 5.1, it should flow through without having to change the settings, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.

Anyone else have this experience?

My example and how I tested...

Settings to Dolby Atmos then:
Booted up Forza Horizon 4 (which supports Atmos)&gt; 5.1 surround no problem.
Booted up Wolfenstein 2 (doesn’t support Atmos) &gt; I DON’T get surround at all.

Switch settings to Dolby 5.1 then:
Booted up Wolfenstein 2 &gt; 5.1 surround is back.

Switching the settings isn’t the end of the world, but I’m just curious if anyone else is experiencing this?",t2_6f7jpnls

Xbox system update crashes at 21%,"Hello
I've got a huge problem. My Xbox One X requires a 567MB system update right at the power up sequence. The thing is, it always crashes at 21%. I've tried everything, even tried with my cellphone as a network hotspot and that didn't worked.

I have 150Gb+ of free space on the hard drive so it can't be a weight issue.

I tried contacting Xbox support, it's ridiculous they don't even let me message them I'm always redirected to a virtual agent (reaaaaally helpful Microsoft....) wich only directs me to troubleshooting..

I'm pretty desperate, it's been 3 days so I don't think it's their servers either.

I don't have an external HD or a USB key, if I had one of those I'd try to do it offline.

I always get the same 3 error codes :
0x80070570 0x00000000 0x90000005

Since Microsoft can't be contacted anymore, I really hope someone got a solution..

My 4-month-old Elite 2 controller's right bumper isn't working unless I press down firmly right in the middle. Microsoft only offers a 90-day warranty. :/,"I bought an Elite 2 controller from Costco back in late May, so just over 4 months ago. 

Last week I noticed the right bumper wasn't registering fully, and it's continued to get worse. Sometimes it's totally fine, but other times I have to press down firmly right in the middle and outward areas don't register at all. This has been hugely frustrating in Warzone, as trying to throw C4 etc. has sometimes not worked responsively.

Microsoft only offers a 90-day warranty of course (sooo ridiculous that a $180 controller is only covered that amount of time!) but I'm hoping Costco will honor it. Thing is, I don't even know if they still stock them (it was an online exclusive at the time).

I was looking at homemade DIY repairs and someone said rubbing alcohol can help sticky buttons (in case it's actually sticky and not broken), but another person said it can damage the internal battery... does anyone know if I'd be OK pouring a tiny bit of rubbing alcohol along the corners? Any other suggestions?

The Difference between Smart Delivery and Cross-buy (from a developer),"As more games start to offer cross-buy you will start to see details on what makes smart delivery a rich feature and not just a term for cross-buy

Here is an example from the game [Maneater](https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads%2Fmaneater-evolves-with-next-gen-enhancements.2336583%2F): 

 

* **This is not a different application/game on XBox Series S &amp; X** and saves and trophies/achievements will carry forward.
   * This may require subscriptions to additional services such as XBox Gold (such as for cloud save transfers)
* **This IS a separate application/game on PlayStation 5** and trophies, stats and saves will not transfer

Xbox one X not turning on,"Very odd scenario, my Xbox One X no longer turns on. I went to watch tv on my Xbox one x and turned it on via the controller, I heard the startup chime, but maybe 3 seconds later I heard the shutdown chime. Confused, I looked over at my controller and it was blinking saying that it unexpectedly lost connection with the console. I went to go turn it on via the power button on the console and now it shows no sign of life at all. I tried different outlets, power cables, etc and it still doesn’t work. Oddly enough my external hard drive lights up when plugged into any of the USB ports while the Xbox one x is plugged in, but it still won’t boot at all.

Xbox problem,"Hey, now before I start I want to say that I haven’t really used Reddit much so I’m not entirely sure if I’m posting in the right place but here we go

I have an issue with my Xbox one, when I power it up, it doesn’t start up. And after about 10 minutes a blank screen comes up, nothing on it just a blank dark screen. And after another 10 minutes a startup error screen comes up. Now I’m not sure what it is but it might be a power supply problem?

A few noob questions,"Hi all,

I've pre-ordered the XSX and am excited to rejoin the Xbox world.

My primary goal is to play locally with my wife... I'm skimming through Gamepass and am a little confused on the distinction between 'split screen/screen sharing' vs 'Xbox Live Local Co-op'

Can we play the latter on one console? Minecraft Dungeons as an example.

If we were to get a second console, would we need a second GamePass account to play Xbox live local co-op together? 

Thank you",t2_5g2yf
Xbox one S random beeping sounds from system while turned off,"Hey there! I'm just posting a quick text post asking if my xbox making very faint beeping noises while it's off is okay and not a bad sign, I don't really remember when it started happening but I would say about half a year ago. I just wanna make sure that it's not something bad. Also if this get some answers I will post a video or some kind of link to a audio clip of the beeping on 20+ db so it can be heard, also sometimes the beeping sounds like a siren but after like 1-3 hours the beeping is gone. After some small research I've read it's maybe the hard drive or caused due to instant on, also seems like hearing beeps causes the console to not be able to turn on, but I've never had a problem since this beeping started, and I've already had this thing fixed once because it wouldn't display anything, but that was before the beeping.",t2_7wgz88g3

Achievements syncing extremely slow and it's my capping download speed.,"I normally play offline and then the next time I go online my achievements ""pop"" when I log-in, but the last few times they are taking absolutely ages, meaning it's ridiculous to try and download or update anything as for some reason it caps my speed to 45mbps while it's trying to sync. When it's finished I can finally download at full speed (200mbps), but it's taking about 30mins to sync a few achievements.

Which, when I just want to pop on and download a game it's ridiculous, I have to was half and hour before I can even use my Xbox properly.

Is there anyway I can force my Xbox to sync my achievements faster? As it never use to be this slow, it's always use to finish syncing within the first 5 minutes.",t2_2b3mroc5

"""X took too long to start""","Hey guys, I've been having a problem on One S for the past couple months now. I've looked in the tech support post and saw that some people have the same issues BUT all of the fixes that have worked for them have done nothing for me so I was hoping if anyone has any other suggestions.. I'm willing to try almost anything at this point.

So here's the issue: NBA 2K20 was working perfectly fine for a few months but up until around May/June iirc the game was beginning to freeze at certain spots. Eventually, this led to the infamous ""X took too long to start"" error. I had believed this to be exclusively a fault with the game itself but soon it started to affect the rest of the console. 
It began with Monster Hunter: World but restarting my console would make MH:W work again. It then spread to FIFA 20 as well and when this happened that's when it really got out of control. Essentially all my games eventually couldn't start except for like Skate 3 which I found strange 😂 

Also on top of most of my games breaking, my Xbox also runs extremely slowly to the point that the scrolling sound on the dashboard sounds like a Transformer. 

So my question, other than if anyone has any solutions, would be is it possible for the actual NBA 2K20 disc to be causing these issues? I tested this on my brother's Xbox as well, also a One S, and it caused the same issues so that's why I now suspect the game itself. 

So some more information that might be relevant to troubleshooting and maybe help someone going through the same:
https://windowsreport.com/took-too-long-to-start-xbox-one-error/

As of today I've officially exhausted every solution on the list and then some. I've re-installed the game online, offline, with the latest update, without the latest update, I've reset to factory settings many times (both keeping games and apps and deleting everything), cleared reserved space, persistent storage, changed my location,, turned instant-on off etc. I think you get the point lol

Umm so it seems okay when I uninstall 2K so I feel confident that it was the game. I'm not convinced it's the disc because when 2K was on Game Pass and I installed it without the disc it still did the same. Is it possible for a game to (effectively) brick a console like this because I was under the assumption that corrupted saved data and files causes this error so I'm really confused.

ANY help would be greatly appreciated!",t2_3m62crs5

Does an Xbox One Series X or S make more sense in my use case?,"I currently have an Xbox One X that I don't play as much anymore. The reason is that I built a gaming pc last year that's not too shabby. (Ryzen 2600X and RTX 2070 with 16GB of ram on an SSD). My main use of the Xbox is for games not available on PC, like Kingdom Hearts III, and for games I already bought before I built my PC and did not want to buy again.

I mostly game on a 1080p 144hz monitor, though 80% the games I play are not high fps, and intensive enough to run between 70-120fps. Occasionally I game on my Samsung 4K TV due to the niceness of easier couch gaming without the Steam casting. However due to my specs, I have to reduce most settings to medium and some to low to maintain a 60fps average (without true sync like my monitor's). That being said, the TV is 60hz (Samsung NU8000 50"" I got a couple years back). I have no intention of buying a new TV. For the record I have a subscription to Game Pass Ultimate.

Currently Gamestop offers $200 when trading in an Xbox One X, meaning the Series S would cost about $100 and the X about $300. For the 1080p 144hz and 4K 60hz on average, which of the two would make most sense? Ideally I'd like to save as much as possible. I don't really care about super high framerate on my monitor since I plan to upgrade my GPU as needed. But I do want a stable 60fps on my 60hz 4K tv without much of a compromise/dip.

Honest question: Will Microsoft buy or is about to buy Thq Nordico / Embracer Group? READ DESCRIPTION !!,"I wonder if it is Thq Nordic for different points:

&amp;#x200B;

* They have published many games on Gamepass and Live.
* In the Embracer group report they make it very clear that their business model will be to work with subscriptions and cloudgaming services.
* They are buying studios, IPs and publishers as if they are working on something big in the short term.
* Phil Spencer recently went to visit the Nordic lands, it is not known if it was for Cyberpunck or for something else.
* And on twitter it is one of the favorites, just search for #Thq and you will see that many think this.

  
Edit: There is also another point, but this may make little sense because I am ignorant about the matter. In July or August they reported on the Embracer group page that they had $ 1.5B (Country currency) in issuance of shares that would help them work in the short and long term in business and purchase more studios, and ... I can't stop to think that's weird ...

Does Microsoft still have a chance against Sony?,"Units Sold / Marketshare:

* WW1 (Xbox vs PS2): 24m vs 155m = 179m total (13% vs. 87%)

* WW3 (X1 vs. PS4): 50m vs 112m = 162m (31% vs. 69%)

I'm really hoping Microsoft wins WW4 between the value they offer, the power of their technology, and their overall consumer-friendly practices.  I honestly think it would be #1 if it weren't for the very turbulent X1 launch, which it largely corrected but it was too late, and exclusive titles that Sony has signed. 

I love the Xbox controller and ecosystem.  It's all very user-friendly and present amazing value to the consumer.  Microsoft consistently comes up with new ideas (like GWG, backwards compat, etc.) that Sony tries to replicate but never pulls off.  Microsoft deserves a win.",t2_ey26l

I finally played Gears 5 while I was home sick.,"I finished Gears 5's campaign today and I justed needed to say that whether or not I go the Xbox Series X or PS5 route (still undecided) I had a blast.  

I've been with the franchise since the start. I even grew up in the city where it was developed (I had a signed copy of Gears of War 3 back home as well, from a midnight release where some developers were doing a signing at a local Gamestop).  Gears of War was the co-op shooter my friends and I played in between Halo releases. We would go through the campaign at scheduled times so no one got left behind and when we beat the story we would play endless rounds of horde and try and beat wave 50 on each map, some nights we were up until 3 am (for reference I was 17 in highschool when 3 came out).  

When Gears of War 4 came out I was excited to get back on and clear it with my friends, but unfortunately they had all grown tired of the series. So me and my younger beat it together and I stuck around for a bit of multiplayer and horde for a bit, no where near as much as 2 or 3.  It was the ultimate experience I had when I was a kid but I appreciated my brother tagging along even if he had no investment to the story or anything. 

So by the time Gears 5 came out I was hesitant to play it, since my brother now lives in a different time zone and doesn't play online as much anymore either.  I had Game pass so I downloaded it. Got in a match of horde just see how it looked and felt. Yup felt like Gears alright.  Then I played the story and stopped about halfway through the second act.  I just wasn't feeling it.  And I pretty much put it out of my mind all together. 

Then this weekend I got a mild cold and couldn't work the last few days.  I figured I could use some action and melodrama so I decided to boot up Gears 5 and sink my teeth in.

I beat it in less then a couple days but what a ride. The story was pretty good honestly, I didn't really appreciate swapping protagonists after only one game in the new trilogy but I ended up preferring Kait over JD overall, she's just something different for the series and her motivation was interesting enough to get me hooked. 

Now while I liked the story, I loved the moments of sheer spectacle.  There were times when I would drop my jaw when I certain scene would happen.  I haven't felt so tiny in a videogame since Halo 2 verses the Scarab.  And I wasn't just tiny, I was the scrappy Outsider on a mission. I was pretty immersed I'd say.  The visuals and sound design, just outstanding. 

But the gameplay, the most I've ever clicked in a Gears of War game.  Using Jack's abilities allowed me to change it up and figure out new tactics.  There were so many hairpin moments where one shot and one second decided whether or not I was going to be a splatter on the screen, and when I pulled it off, just fantastic.  Or when I was using the GL Lancer and managed to get 4-5 drones in one shot during an intense fight. So satisfying.  And that's the other thing every firefight was tense and after each one it only ramped up and up.  Oh and the boss fight in act 2, I died countless times but eventually when I overcame it I got that sigh of relief that I honestly haven't had with a game for a while.  This game made me feel like a kid again going, ""what the fuck?!"" like I did when I was in highschool with my friends. 

I didn't care too much for the open world. I liked the side objectives alright, nothing memorable, the component parts kept me checking every nook and cranny, and the skiff when it got up to speed was really fun to drive, but it felt too empty and padding to validate it being there.  You could've kept the linear level design and maybe had an optional side mission you could either ignore or do along the route and it'll bring you back to where you were, but I guess they were just following trends or something.  

I gotta say I didn't expect to write a full review like this before 10pm, but I was just surprised how much I actually enjoyed this game.  I look back on the series fondly but when I'm away from it I usually just think of it as ""The big dudes shoot at the ugly dude behind a well placed wall"" and kinda just write it off.  But when I'm actually playing it, I get it.  It is definitely just like I described but it's got more to it then I remembered and I'm glad I got this cold so I could play it.  Whether or not I stick with Xbox or not this was a good game to finish this generation on.

Why 4K-60FPS must be the new standard?,"I would make this as clear as possible, when you tell your developers their game must support 4K 60 FPS, you actually telling them to lower the graphics specs of the game. (As long as its not an indie game)

To run a game on 4k 60FPS you need a really strong Computer, and I know the Xbox series X is pretty strong but still not enough.

People need to understand that a game can look a lot better on 1080P 60FPS than 4k 60 FPS and even 4k 30 fps sometimes , because there are other aspects of graphics other than resolution...

This statement of almost everything needs to support ""4K 60 FPS"" will make games look about the same as now as we play them on our current generation consoles with the difference of them running 4K on the new consoles. That's wrong.",t2_jkkuzsz

Who do you watch/follow for discussions on gaming?,"I was wondering who/what the sources are people follow for discussing gaming news. 

I'm not talking about IGN or Gamespot or other, big websites that break news and such; I'm talking more about individuals on social media that give their quick takes but still produce quality content at the same time. Where it's not the same information you could find elsewhere. 

One example would be someone like Brad Sams who is on YouTube and just drops the news and gives his thoughts on it. He is specific to Microsoft products of all kinds but I still enjoy him for his Xbox takes. Another is ReviewTechUSA who has a few videos throughout the day and then has a livestream at night where he just fields questions via chats. 

Surely there are more people like this and these are just two that I've found after getting an interest back in gaming after nearly a decade away from it.

Is there anyone else that has a similar setup for their channels and discusses things in a similar way? I guess Lew Later is another presentation style to use as an example.",t2_3b3ly

"I heard a rumor that the Devs are a little more active in paying attention to the customers wants more than the PS4 devs. Is this true, and could you possibly link me to examples?","Life has pulled me from Xbox, but if this is true, I would much rather migrate my library for an even slightly improved user experience. 

(More about me and my experience. TL;DR's by the paragraph) 

**TL;DR** - Don't choose a system based off what other people have. If they actually play the same games as you, they probably don't have the time to. 

I think it's been about five years since I switched. At the time I had a bunch of co-workers and a few friends on the  PlayStation side when I decided to go with the crowed. Since then, I've spent maybe 5% of my play time playing with other PlayStation users. 


**TL;DR** -  My games aren't proprietary and people sound better muted


The overall experience has been rather bland to be honest. The community is pretty toxic in the games I play based on the majority of interactions. (If you didn't know already, I'm absolute garbage and my mother is a very social woman.) I mainly play Apex, RocketLeague, and lately I've really enjoyed Ancestors The Humankind Odyssey. Other than that the games I play really aren't exclusive to the platform. 


**TL;DR** - Entertainment apps are slow and the overall UI feels so cumbersome

The UI is as impractical today as it was the day I got the console. You can group games into folders, but you can't take certain apps out of the entertainment folder. It takes about - okay I timed it. It took exactly 54.26 seconds and 4 to 5 clicks from the home screen just to  open Netflix. NETFLIX dude. YouTube is double the clicks because it's positioned further away in the folder of ""Can't Take It Out"". This might sound ridiculous, but I've at so many cold dinners just trying to set up a movie I *want* to watch. Call me crazy, but I don't remember Xbox's home screen being so insanely difficult. 


**TL;DR** - Partying up is easily 10x harder than I remember Xbox being. 

""Starting a party? Sure! Lemme just create the room..........okay I..... I think that's it............oh wait! I gotta invite the person hah, my fault!"" - PS4

My console doesn't speak in the ""traditional sense"", but you get the idea. 


**TL;DR** - If you think you have memory, think again. 

It is entirely possible to have a significant amount of storage left that would more than cover the size of a games update, BUT apparently you have to be able to load up TWICE the amount of complete storage the game requires or something like that simply because, 
""That's how it is."" - SONY rep
This meant that in order to update Red Dead Redemption, or Call of Duty MW; I needed to have about 150-200gb free at all times. Luckily I got the terabyte console to house these games on! 
""Just buy the disc!"" That is a wonderful idea, except RDR2 *is* a disc.  
I feel cheated out of multiple titles. I didn't mention Starwars Battlefront because I got it in the free game of the month offer. 


**TL;DR** - The controller sucks ass. 


**TL;DR** - Gameplay recoding is far superior on Xbox 

I've since gotten used to this, but damn I miss remembering how much better clipping gameplay was on Xbox... Have they made improvements? Tell me about the rabbits...



Okay, I think I've said enough. There's some more I look for that I'm not getting into, but my update finally downloa- alright it still has to install.

Can't play Destiny 2 on same network with other Xbox,"Been tearing my hair out over this issue reading countless forum and reddit posts, trying all suggestions without success and I'm about at my limit.

Hardware:

Modem: Arris SB8200

Router: Netgear Nighthawk AC1750 (R6700v3)

Xbox One X (x2)


The problem:

My room mate and I can play together just the two of us in a fireteam for hours without issue, but if we bring a friend into the fireteam and attempt to do an activity, one of us will get booted, every time.

Some other interesting details present are:

- In the Xbox friends list, I appear offline to him even though I'm not set to Appear Offline.

- Given the above, if he sends me an invite to anything, I won't get it, but, I can send him invites, and he does get it.


What I've tried:

- Automatic IPs, UPnP enabled = can't play at all without being disconnected almost immediately with a wide assortment of Bungie error codes (beaver, eel, etc)

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled = same result

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled, + putting one Xbox in DMZ = same result

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled + IPv6 enabled = we can play without issue


At this stage, I should mention, within the Xbox Advanced Network settings, we both have Open NATs, differently assigned port numbers, and show IPv4 &amp; IPv6 in use.


Now, when we attempt playing with others in the fireteam, my NAT remains Open while the other Xbox gets a Moderate NAT (and as mentioned, one of us will get booted after starting an activity).


To try and solve this, I tried:

- Disabling UPnP, reset router, Re-enabling UPnP, reset router again, then reset modem, and both Xbox's = same issue

- Disabling UPnP, enable port forwarding for ports 88, 500, 3074, 3544, and 4500 on one system, and 89, 501, 3075, 3544, and 4501 on the other, reset everything like above = same result


This should NOT be necessary at all to get two systems working.  Almost every help topic I come across about this mentions how Bungie is a clueless pos when it comes to networking so, I'm confident it IS on their end (and maybe some of XBL too given what I mentioned about appearing offline and invites not working), but, clearly some people can make it work with all these fixes, and others make it work with no configuration at all.


Things I've not tried yet:

- Getting a 2nd IP from Comcast (from what I understand this should definitively fix the issue)

- Getting a different router


I'm not sure a 2nd IP is available to me, that's something I need to call about, but if it's not available then...

As for another router, what I'd love to know is, for those with multiple Xbox's who play Destiny 2 together without any extra configuration, what is the router that you're using?  I want it.

Any help with this is appreciated!",t2_5fbf4cz

"Good news for external HDD users, great news for external SSD users.","[https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1310571820999823362?s=20](https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1310571820999823362?s=20)

The load times for legacy games off a USB SSD are nearly on par with loading off the internal NVMe SSD.  It's *under a second* difference when loading Assassin's Creed Origins.   This shows that backwards compatible games don't need to be taking up valuable internal space to be played with the really quick loads.

&amp;#x200B;

Why isn't there much difference between the internal SSD and an external SSD?  It's probably because the processing of data off the drive is the real bottleneck.

&amp;#x200B;

This is explored in the [Ars Technica preview](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/xbox-series-x-hands-on-the-big-back-compat-dive-begins/) where they loaded off a USB mechanical drive with the Series X and also achieved very significant gains.

A story behind the new Flight Sim Japan Update trailer,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalJaTmv-TY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalJaTmv-TY)

A trailer for Flight Sim Japan Update was re-uploaded a few hours ago to celebrate its launch and to reflect some feedback regarding a political controversy.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima\_Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima_Island)

In the original video released during TGS, there was a scene with Hashima Island, a.k.a ""*Warship* Island"", a small island that were originally developed as a coal mine. During WWII, the island became a sort of 'labor camp', as Korean and Chinese civilians and prisoners were sent to the island to work at the mine under very harsh condition. 

After the initial trailer was uploaded, people immediately complained about the place being introduced as a 'beautiful scenery'. As exotic and beautiful as it may appear from the sky above, it represents a painful war memory for the survivors from the labor camp that are still alive to this day.

Microsoft told South Korean media 5 days ago that they were sorry and the trailer would be updated to remove the scene. [https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=110559](https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=110559) (a link for a Korean news article)

&amp;#x200B;

And a few hours ago, the old trailer was removed as the new one got uploaded.

Xbox One Recordings: It is a case of luck,"Hi Guys,

I believe that there are dozens of posts about this but all of them suggests the same full power reset which doesn't always solve the problem.

The biggest disappointment with my current Xbox One X even with S is when you have that awesome kill, hit record, go check it later and all you have is a 6s video. The same applies to external storage which enables 1h recording.  
To try to avoid that, I always hit record like 2-4 times to make sure it will save.  


I believe I have tried everything:

* Full power reset. I always turn off/full power off the console, then turn off the wall socket - Australia power socket
* USB stick 3.0, good one
* External  Toshiba 128GB USB 3.0 mSATA  \~380MB/s
* External Silicon Power 1TB NVMe PCIe USB 3.0 storage which used to be my main storage and crazy fast loading. But the console would freak out sometimes which recently I discover it has to be an NGFF SATA so I went back to my WD 3TB USB 3.0 where all my games are stored and played from  \~480MB/s
* I've tried different USB ports from the console
* Even recording to the console which limits you to 2min, you end up with 6s videos.

I don't wanna spend thousands with captures devices, I am not a bloody YouTuber haha  
I don't wanna lose my 4K HDR TV either, the majority of the devices limit the output to 1080p

My recording setting is set to 1080p. I have even tried 720p before and still.

Is there anyone with an up to do date solution for this annoying issue?

Thanks a lot guys",t2_4d6mk7x6

Because the airpods connect to the iPad it works really well. When I was able to switch to the TV to keep playing, I just plugged my iPad in and use the TV screen to play.

Does this mean my XOne X is broken?,"I was playing theHunter, and suddenly my screen went to black, and then showed I've no signal. I tried all the common things like hard reset (holding the power + eject buttons for 10 seconds, switching HDMI cables, TV's, nothing worked)

The other options were very difficult, opening the console up and messing around with the HDD (like switching with another one to see if that's the cause of the issue) and HDMI ports (soldering stuff scares me)

I then got 1 more idea before going deep. I saw people recommending changing settings to people who have TV disconnection issues, like Bit 10 to 8 and shit which obviously I couldn't do because I have no signal.

So then, I thought maybe I could stream my Xbox to my laptop and it works!

So my question is, does this mean the HDMI port is the definitive issue? So far, all settings I've tried didn't help, are there any more specific settings I could try before giving up?

I haven't tried doing a factory reset, will it delete my saved games etc?

Any help will be appreciated guys, this console was my pandemic savior, now all I'm left with is a shitty laptop.",t2_874m4ogs
Questions for those that have played NBA 2K21 or Madden 21?,"I've been debating on buying the new Madden and NBA games, but everything I read says they are horrible. For those that have played, are they really that bad? Is it just a copy and paste of last year's editions or have they gotten worse?

For 2k, I know the shot stick has changed drastically, but how bad is this game? I looked up user reviews and read generally horrid reviews with an average rating of about 1.5/5.

I still enjoy playing NBA 2K20 (my career/my league) mostly, but am wondering if I am better off just sticking to 20 until patches come out and the rookie class is added. 

As for Madden, I'm hesitant because nothing I've seen looks any different from last year. I've seen countless glitch plays instead of highlights and the field mode, while exciting, wouldn't compel me to purchase it for solely that mode. 


Tl;dl: Asking for a general review if you've played madden 21 or nba 2k21. Do you enjoy them? Are they as bad as everyone is saying?",t2_3bn9qpr7

Xbox All Access Pre-Order,"I see there are a lot on here that like me, were allowed to apply for Xbox All Access, get approved, get a line of credit, and get denied a console. I also know there are many that haven't received any email even though this happened to them as well.

I've been making a lot of noise on Twitter for the last 6 days. MS sent emails stating that they were working on a solution, Gamestop is promising pre-orders to those affected through their site.

MS support emailed me stating there is no plan yet, and closed my ticket.

I'm hoping MS and Gamestop do the right thing here, but with the exception of the email there has not been any communication, and no public acknowledgement.

I have been trying to get IGN, Gamespot, Polygon, Kotaku, etc. to pick up the story. Eurogamer published a story about the same thing happening in the UK. I think that if the story got picked up by one of these US sites, it could put the pressure on MS and Gamespot to do the right thing and follow through.

Dramatic? Maybe...but I care about my credit quite a bit and this whole thing is really leaving a sour taste in my mouth. I want Microsoft to do better. I want them to fix this broken system so this doesn't happen again.

- similarly to the point above, it looks tiny, which raises my concern about overheating, but I guess we will not know until we test it ourselves
- is it safe buying the first batches (2020) or are there usually build quality imperfections?

A crossover game but more horde style?,"I’ve been seeing a lot of rosters for a smash-style game or Mario kart rip-off and have been wondering why not make it horde style in which you fend off against enemy armies from across the games (like covenant, flood and forerunner from halo, locusts from gears, and demons from doom, etc...)which each protagonist having their unique FPS or third person shooting mechanics.

What I mean by unique styles is like master chief having his op guns and bases but can’t hide behind cover and is first person while Marcus is third person and can blind fire but is more around using cover mechanics and doom slayer just runs around blasting, they can even extend this to have like ori being small and having little health but can move quickly and they can even have those orbs he uses to blink through around the map so he can get behind cover. Or have corvo/ Elizabeth as stealth users to sneak up on enemies, ofc there is going to need to be a lot of balancing but I can see this working or at least being far better than copying a Nintendo game with obvious backlash to come with.

Fable 3 co op,"So I just recently downloaded Fable 3 onto my Xbox one to start playing again. I had progressed through the story up until I have to meet Ben Finn outside the Bowerstone Castle. My friend decided he wanted to play as well, so we made him an account and progressed him to about Brightwood. I jumped in to his account with my own separate profile (Outside Bowerstone Castle) but then I had left the session without signing out or turning off my controller. Once he had gone into the Reliquary it had auto saved, but it didn’t make either one of us think twice. He said he wanted me to join, so I did (again). This time I joined as an exact copy of him (in Dweller gear and only 23 Guild Seals). I was extremely confused and went to load my Bowerstone Castle save only to see it overwritten?

Question about controller faceplates,"So I have a scuf infinity that I bought a few years ago that needs a new faceplate. From what I gather they just took a model 1697 xbone controller and added the paddles to the back. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a (somewhat decent and not sketchy) replacement faceplate for that model. I DO however see a lot of good replacement faceplates for the 1698 model, which is the original elite controller. I know that there is the hole for the profile switch in the middle, but besides that, would that faceplate work on a 1697 controller?

I know there are discrepancies like not being able to use the “scuf rings” to hotswap the thumb sticks (which I don’t even have on the right as it blocks my kontrol freek) and the hole in the middle, but as long as I can screw it in and it will be a compatible fit I will be happy. I just don’t feel like spending $170 on a series 2 controller because of the faceplate (especially considering i copped 2 series x’s for me and family). And I’ve taken apart the controller many times and also replaced the bumpers, so I’m trying to squeeze all the life out of this one first lol.

"With Xbox/Microsoft now owning Bethesda I strongly believe they should pull the Skyblivion crew into actual business, give them support they need and then launch Skyblivion as an official remaster of Oblivion.","I know this idea might rub some people the wrong way, and you could technically make the argument that it's an ""add-on mod"" for Skyrim right now, but my point is for years I've watched the small crew of Skyblivion devs work their magic and truly give Oblivion a much needed and appreciated make-over.

I think now that Xbox has Bethesda, they should look at what the Skyblivion guys are doing, draw them into the fold as part of Bethesda officially, but let them continue doing what they want and then re-launch Oblivion as a remaster using what they've done.

Obviously I am not talking about just taking their work. I mean bring them into the fold as a dev team doing this Oblivion update *on the side* to the rest of Bethesda. 

To me, it's a no-brainer. Bethesda has already re-done Skyrim a few times, but why not bring in the Skyblivion people and let them do Oblivion *officially* now, giving them the money and resources to pull it all off, definitively?

TES:VI is probably 4-5 years away at least. In the meantime, we already have the Skyblivion people doing wonderful things to Oblivion, so launching it as the ""official"" Oblivion remaster in the meantime would actually be an amazing idea to hold people over until TES:VI and one thing's for sure a official Oblivion ""remaster"" in the meantime as an exclusive would help establish the Elder Scrolls series as Xbox's now-current crown jewel. 

Do you think this is a bad idea? How could it not be a good thing, at least as a proposal?",t2_ld6gr
Some good points made by Parris regarding Zenimax Exclusivity,,t2_hyaz4
Do you think Best Buy will reserve/honor a console for those who signed up All-Access like Gamestop and MS?,"Hi everyone, I've just joined this sub and I'm super excited for the Series S and X to drop this fall! I can't wait to be back in the xbox family (hopefully) soon.

I have a question that's similar to what I'm sure a lot of other people have had, and I've been hoping to get some sort of update but I can't get a reliable answer from either Citizens One, Microsoft, or Best Buy. I tried to preorder the Series S through Best Buy last week, and I was able to get all my info in for All-Access, but I was kicked out of process before I could successfully order a console. Now, I have an approved line of credit from Citizens One with nothing to use it on, and no idea how I would go about applying it if and when pre-orders come back before launch (I'm guessing we could use the account number?). 

I know MS and Gamestop have realized the predicament this puts a lot of people who signed up for all-access in, and they've reached out to customers, but Best Buy (and I believe also Wal-Mart, unless I missed an update), have been silent on the issue so far. With that in mind, I was wondering if you guys had heard anything from Best Buy, or if right now my only course of action is just to hope I can secure a console before my line of credit is closed from inactivity. 

Thank you guys so much, and one way or another I'm excited to be back on xbox soon!!",t2_16rpds
Xbox System Updates,"The one thing where I think PS4 has the advantage (apart from their great exclusive games for now) is the way they handle system updates.

I was playing Mafia Definitive Edtion earlier. I just got to Chapter 18 and I was loving it. I was in the middle of a tense cutscene and BAM ""Its time to update!"" I got booted off my game to update my system. PS4 does this in the background and lets you know when it's ready to install, so you can do this at your own leisure. Why can't Xbox do this?

Pretty hard to build fable 4 hype when fable 2 on gamepass is broken,"In order to get fable 2 on Xbox one to work without freezing every 5-20 minutes (once you get it past freezing on the game’s  main menu screen) you can run it offline which apparently fixes it. however not all of us have our home Xbox’s readily available, so the game won’t work in offline mode. I’ve tried clearing cache, hard resetting console and redownloading game.  Doesn’t work! It’s a fucking travesty they don’t give a shit about their own exclusives. Is it too much to ask for a AAA game to work in a way without work arounds, when I pay good money for a subscription said game is included in ? It really shouldn’t be.

SCARLET NEXUS | Story Trailer: Yuito,,t2_pxzx4
Looking for RPGs with good writing and a blankish-slate main character,"I like well-written RPGs with a protagonist whose name and backstory aren't pre-determined. I'm willing to allow *some* leeway on that. The KOTOR games, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Dragon Age: Origins and Inquisition give your character a vague backstory, but you can sort of play around that. You aren't locked into a particular role.

I also prefer a darker tone to a goofy one. The more roleplaying opportunity, the better.

Aside from the games mentioned above, here are some other games that I have really enjoyed that fit what I'm looking for in some way or another:

The Baldur's Gate Saga

Pathfinder: Kingmaker

Pillars of Eternity

Neverwinter Nights

Obviously I'm open to games with different playing styles, but I tend really not to like the arcade/MMORPG style of Inquisition, even though I thought it had a great story. For the best combo of writing and gameplay, I would take the writing of F:NV and the gameplay of FO4, although I think that the writing of FO4 is still pretty good. 

One game I'm considering is The Outer Worlds. It looks like it may be a tad goofier than I am normally attracted to, but if it's well-written, fun to play, and allows for some good roleplaying, then I'm open to giving it a chance. Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps popping up, but the story doesn't sound all that interesting to me. But who knows.

Fortnite playing Game Chat through Speakers on Xbox One S,"Good afternoon everyone. If you're reading this, I hope you and your family are well! 

I've searched this and can't seem to find an answer because it seems that the problem is being misunderstood.

I understand that you can set Party Chat to play through your Headset, Speakers, or Both in the Xbox Settings.

There is not a setting, AFAIK, that affects the in-game voice chat of each game. Individual games have their own settings for this, such as Destiny, to allow you play game voice chat through your speakers. If Fortnite has this option, I've never seen it. I've also never had this issue before but for some reason people's voices are playing through both my Headset and my speakers on both my TV and my monitor.

You know what grinds my gear? The super tiny text in xbox one games.,"\*Start old man rant\* I got my xbox one s about a year ago, and one thing i noticed right away was how small the text is in the games. It is like these games were designed for you to sit 3 feet in front of your tv.

My living room layout, I have a 40"" 1080p tv, and I sit about 15 feet away on the sofa. Last generation games everything was fine, text was legible, graphics were good. Got a xbox one s, and now i have to sit 5 feet in front of the screen on the floor to be able to read the stats and status messages on the screen. 

Maybe my eyes are getting worse, or games are getting too text heavy that they need to cram a ton of text on the screen at once. I constantly have to tell my daughter not to sit so close to the screen. 

I have game pass, so I tried lots of games. Any game with stats and numbers, are super tiny. I enjoy ubisoft games, so maybe it is mostly ubisoft (watchdogs1,2, assassins creed, the division 1,2)

Will there ever be a *true* Xbox handheld?,"I know that some people may have mentioned this before but I just want to say it. Will Microsoft ever make a true handheld gaming system like Nintendo or Sony? I kind of already know about the XCloud but I feel that is not a true handheld console. It would be pretty awesome to have one that is a dedicated handheld xbox console with its own operating system. I feel like the XCloud is just a cop out to not actually make a handheld system. I feel like Microsoft has had since the early 2000's to get it together in this regard but continues to fail on delivering what I believe people actually want.

XBOX fan and UI/UX Designer here,"Why the new XBOX STORE look so cheap and feel laggy as hell ? Navigation is awful, transition between games feel just broken, The global rectangular design is not respected and there is no logic in navigation.

There is three layers of border on the item selected, 2/3 of my screen display useless information about the game I didn’t selected yet, everything feels just wrong. 

Did you feel the same thing? Am I the only one who cares about this kind of thing, so I shouldn't? I like my console and the system design created by Microsoft three years ago, but here I feel like I’m browsing in a failed imitation attempt, and it hurts.

"All Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 replacements were broken, now says I'm out of warranty","I bought this Elite Controller Series 2 from Best Buy for $180. I noticed after a couple of weeks that the face buttons were unresponsive if you pressed them at certain angles. The button would be pressed, but it wouldn't register. It was maddening. Best Buy's return window was 15 days though and it was too late by the time I figured it out. : ( I sent it in to MS for replacement. 

I received a used controller with a half-dead RB button and left stick drift. This was worse than the first one!  I wish I hadn't sent it in. I sent that one back for replacement again. It took a while to get it back cause of COVID, which is understandable. 

I got my 3rd controller, and this one had a broken right-stick tensioner (it would not tighten up), intermittently working bottom-left paddle button, and has some trouble connecting to the PC occasionally. This is getting bad. 

I just logged on to begrudgingly send it back again, and says I'm out of warranty. I haven't had a fully-working controller from the start and now I'm left with one that doesn't always connect, and when it does, it has issues, which are surely going to compound. 

I know not everyone has these problems with their elite controllers, and I wish I was one of them, but this was not my experience.",t2_9sclr

I thought of an idea for Microsoft/Playstation so physical games could be still relevant in the future,"Why not adapt the serial key design that PC uses on software in the past? The disc is used to install the game on the hardware and requires a serial key to activate on your account. The game converts into a digital game and the disc is no longer needed to play the game.

Applying the serial key is automatic as well. It's as easy as putting the disc in and it will ask the user if they want to tether this license to this account. 

If you want to lend a game to your friend, all your friend needs to do is to put that same disc into his console and will notify him that it's registered to another user and will deactivate the previous owner's copy and apply the license to him instead.

However; This method would probably involve an internet connection for physical games to be played and installed for the first time. Also ""legacy games"" aka xbox 360/xbox one disc games probably won't be able to implement such a feature.

It might be too late now but perhaps in the future?

"If you have a Xbox One X, you might want to hold off on upgrading to the Series X for about a year. Here's why:","Don't downvote me into oblivion just yet. Hear me out.

I'm *not* saying don't get the Series X. I currently have a One X and already have my pre-order for the Series X, after all. 

However, if you already have an Xbox One X like me, it might not be the upgrade you were expecting... yet.

Here's why:

- Only the newest TV's with HDMI 2.1 can take full advantage of the power of the Series X to display 4K at **120 fps** (and output uncompressed Dolby Atmos audio). The *vast* majority of people with 4K TVs still have HDMI 2.0, which is limited to 4K at **60 fps** (and can't output uncompressed Dolby Atmos audio).

- However, there's very little reason to upgrade your TV to HDMI 2.1, because Aaron Greenburg said that 4K @ **60fps** will be the [""standard output""](https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x-features-60-fps-standard-output-confirms-xboxs-aaron-greenberg#:~:text=Today%2C%20Xbox's%20Aaron%20Greenberg%20said,appear%20to%20be%20the%20case.) on the Series X.

**The Xbox One X and current HDMI 2.0 TVs can *already* do that.**

- The biggest reason I wanted to upgrade to the Series X immediately was to play next gen games with ray tracing. However, Halo Infinite wasn't going to launch with ray tracing (hopefully it will after the indefinite delay?), and neither will Valhalla or Cyberpunk. Ray tracing on big titles doesn't seem to be coming until next year, at the earliest.

So, even if you have the latest 4K TV with HDMI 2.1, you'll still just be playing ""next gen"" games at 4K 60fps, with no ray tracing, which **the Xbox One X is already capable of doing right now**.

New games will release on the current generation for the foreseeable future, and Smart Delivery makes upgrading *immediately* even less necessary.

So, the only remaining advantages of upgrading from the One X to the Series X *right now* are:

- Faster loading times
- More *stable* 60fps framerate 
- Quick resume
- Faster UI?

If you have an original Xbox One or Xbox One S, the Series X is a huge upgrade immediately.

However, if you have a Xbox One X, you might want to wait until the big titles are enhanced with ray tracing next year, the price drops, and you don't have to fight the crowds.

EDIT: Others have brought up that your One X will inevitably lose value if you wait to sell it or trade it in, so that's another factor to consider, as well. However, prices on next gen consoles will likely drop next year, especially Black Friday sales, so it might be a wash.",t2_b6lw9

Now to the annoying part, why i can't even go on youtube without spotting 5 videos titled ""will Microsoft make bethesda games exclusive"" yes they have made beloved franchises but business is business and they were bought by Microsoft I dont understand the hate towards them possibly going down an exclusivity route.
 It just seems to me Microsoft got the upper hand and people aren't entirely happy about it. None the Iess i wanted to make this post to find like minded people so we can maybe bring awareness to that toxic behavior within the gaming community. 
One thing Microsoft is pushing is freedom to play wherever one wants, hopefully one day that means Playstation aswell.",t2_47pz74mo

Anyone have trouble enjoying Single Player games over Multieplayer ones?,"Well I am sure but I just wanted to discuss how for the past two years (Ish) I cant seem to sit and play single player games for more than like an hour at a time.

I can happily spend hours on an MMO like WoW, TESO, FF14, or League of Legends, or on Xbox I love to play fortnite, Siege, Dauntless, MHW.   


In a way it really angers me because I feel like I am missing out on some truly great games, and once in a blue moon I will go through and smash out a game in a couple days (Yakuza series, darksiders 3, Red Dead Redemption 2 which was a loooong game but fun as hell). I get into a foul mood cause I will bounce from game to game booting it up only to quit and pick a different one, then I will install, uninstall, reinstall games I convince myself I wanna play/replay then convince myself I am not interested.

"Microsoft played a great move by buying ZeniMax Media but they could change the landscape forever by doing one simple thing. I’m surprised they’ve not talked about it. Timing is crucial. Do it ASAP, Microsoft.","Why has Phil Spencer / Todd Howard / Pete better yet Microsoft or ZeniMax not even hinted at this yet? 

MODDING! CREATION CLUB! utilise it! I’m over the moon about this deal it’s nothing but good news, but I feel Microsoft are just not realising something here as if I was them I’d get to work on announcing it ASAP.  

Microsoft now essentially own the rights to these excellent franchises, timeless classics that people still play to this day (Elder Scrolls Skyrim / Fallout 4) now these were the first titles to receive mod support on console.  Which is great it’s a excellent baby step.  But then came along Creation Club okay initially a step backwards but let’s not underestimate its usage here, it provides more income towards the studios and at the same time gives its users more content with the excellent benefit of being graded content that lets you expand your game whilst also STILL enabling ACHIEVEMENTS.  

So a lot of people and I know a lot of people do this, they get one of these games, buy creation club content, love it for adding to the game, and once they get 1000g, they get the real reward which is actual mods, that completely change the game to something new. BUT that’s after they’ve done everything so by then they usually drop it for PC which is just unfetted access to brilliant content, nice.  

However it’s been years since these were created and the flak has settled down, and a lot of people do not want to play on PC and not get achievements on Xbox they don’t care about steam achievements, they care about their progression on Xbox, we’re their main characters are.  Tons of people.  Some people also just have preferences.  

There is DLC that has come or is coming to PC which is just insane! sheer insanity and the work gone into these things are beyond crazy.  Why is Microsoft not helping the devs ship these ideas to console? unifying it all for PC / Xbox ? do it now! it’s insane.  Here are some examples. 

Fallout 4: 

Fallout: Miami 
- Trailer:  https://youtu.be/aPtAjvtJhf8

Apologise for the lack of fallout 4 examples I personally don’t mod it much because I prefer to play it on Xbox and I currently don’t have 1000g on it.  


Elder Scrolls Skyrim: 
- Familar Faces (amazing mod) it lets you do new game plus but your old characters are characters in your new play through. 

- Beyond Skyrim: (creating all of Tamriel within Skyrim) 
Example: https://youtu.be/oCRWN2Emgbw 

- Skyblivion: 
https://youtu.be/68uUeZGppXw

- Ordinator (essentially a adds massive amounts of skill tree perks (I think it’s over 500 new skills). 

I have played a lot of these on PC tons of them I’ve even missed out hundreds more I’m just listing some examples.  But now Microsoft own both ends of the pipeline, come on and do something already.  I love modding on my PC but I also get bored when I know my progress isn’t really going forward on the system I game mainly on which is Xbox and the choice would be lovely to have, I’d even pay for these mods and wished their was creation club versions to support both Microsoft and the creators/modders.  The option should exist and now there is no excuse, none and it benefits everyone involved.  Yes these are old games, but game pass is the perfect platform to grow this still.  Let’s be honest TES6 is years away, this is the perfect time to get this going.  (I play Skyrim special edition to this day on Xbox STILL) so do my friends.  Not everyone wants to HAVE to use a PC and a load order download to do this.  People also want their progress and achievements earn able with mods on, so certify these mods, charge me I don’t care just do it.  And those opposed to creation club, well you can’t complain since these would be free in the mods list anyway or you have PC.  There is nothing wrong with choice.  

Creation Club content is spares, short and usually expensive, there is no trying to pretend it’s not, but it gives us the ability to get achievements and it works with the game giving it an authentic certified feel.  So why has the content just forzen to a halt? it’s discounted a lot which is nice, but if Microsoft allowed or begun the process of getting the back log of thousands of mods onto it, surely this would lower the cost over time since there would be enough content there to of course offset such things, and why is the space for these mods so short?.  

It’s awful that this hasn’t been requested or talked about much and the potential to have an strong instant effect that is positive for both PC users and Xbox users right now is there.  Yet I feel Microsoft will just sit on it and do nothing.  

You know what else this would do? show up Sony and how their policies are kinda of bad in this day and age, it would also give a lot of people reasons to stick with Xbox/PC and game pass, it’s on equal footing than even letting PlayStation have access to TES6.  PlayStation users could have TES6 but if modding / creation club and all these amazing ideas were made “official” that would mean a lot more to many many people and having TES6 on PlayStation wouldn’t mean a thing in contrast because the real experience is on Xbox/ PC (it’s already on PC).  

So what I’m trying to say is WE as a community need to get the ball rolling, spread the word and more done, we need a dialogue with Microsoft to let them know how important this is.  Because I’m pretty sick of having to use PC for this, I want it official I want to have choice and I don’t care how.  I want my Bethesda games to last me a lot longer and surprise me everyday whilst I can get achievements and progress.  We need to hear what Microsoft thinks because no real roadblock is in the way now.  It should be a thing.   I just don’t see much mentioned since the deal has gone down.  I’d expect it to be high priority.   

Anyway, I’m just pretty sick of hoping.  I want information and i imagine so many others do too.

Edit:  il also add shutting these creators down and resetting everything to ZERO would be the dumbest move that could possibly be played.",t2_42lnl6wp

My first non-Nintendo purchase in a decade,"Don't get me wrong, I love Nintendo dearly for Zelda, but that's really been the only series I've played in the last ten or more years. Growing up I could only have one console, and I chose Zelda. I realized recently that I could actually have more than one console and not go broke (or I could go broke but at this point in the year I don't give a shit).

I wish I could describe the feeling of getting something on which I could play all sorts of ""mature"" games like COD, Forza, Witcher, Assassin's Creed. I know you can play some of these on Switch but it's just not the same. I understand Nintendo has their own goals that don't line up necessarily with Microsoft and Sony regarding online play and cutting edge graphics, but it's a huge change coming from a lifetime of Nintendo to Xbox. I'm happy I didn't buy one of these earlier in my youth because I wouldn't have got a damn thing done. Anyone else come to xbox after a long time with Nintendo?",t2_5yomj

Will Microsoft have limited edition consoles at launch or soon after?,"My main question is when is comes to limited edition consoles like the cyberpunk 2077 Xbox one X or even the battlefield 1 one s that I currently have, is the series X expected to have limited edition designs like this at launch? 

I am very excited for the Xbox series X and would like to pre order one, the only problem is that I would also love to get my hands on any sort of limited edition console. 

Seeing as I do not have much money and would only be able to by one console, will there be limited editions at launch? Or will I have to wait a couple months to buy one? 

I know there may not be much conclusive information out there right now, but I'm just wondering what Microsoft has done in the past in regards to that. 

I have never bought any consoles at launch so I'm not really sure myself, I only bought the one s after it had been out for quite a while.

Should I pre order or wait?

Are Xbox Pivoting Away From Achievements/Gamerscore?,"Over the last few software updates, both on the console (removing achievements tab), and on the android/iOS apps (no reference to achievements and gamerscore at all) it seems Microsoft is pivoting away from them. 

I’ve noticed even the splash screens on Windows games and iOS games don’t show your gamerscore either when you sign in like they used to.

If Microsoft discontinued achievements and gamerscore I would be extremely disappointed and would definitely move across to Sony as they are very nostalgic and a source of pride and after amassing over 500,000 gamerscore over 12 years on Xbox if Microsoft just got rid of them I feel they would lose a huge amount of goodwill from the achievement hunting community as it is a major element of what ties us to the ecosystem.

I know there are many people that have no interest but sites like TrueAchievements have huge engagement and I think Xbox are making a mistake by moving away from them.",t2_4s6iwx90

"I said ""fuck it"" and pulled the trigger on a one X today.","I have mainly gamed on a Switch and 3DS for the last few years. I had a ps4 but I honestly hate Sony's business ethics and I felt no connection to the first party games besides God of War. I wanted a newer system come next month. Me and my wife were able to secure a ps5 for my son and I was left in the dust. I couldn't get a hold of an Xbox series S or X, and no ps5.  I felt stupid for calling stores asking if they had any pre-orders left and when I was laughed at during a call it really sucked. 

I hate having a 1080p console on a 4k tv. It looks awful and unnatural. I wanted a new system that could hit true 4K. Sony's fake checkerboard crap wasn't going to cut it. I got a refurbished xbox one X with a one year warranty for $280. I figured that since Xbox was behind on 1st party support right now this could give me the time to play games like Far Cry 5 before jumping to the new gen. At least two years.

So I am now on the Microsoft band wagon and I hope I am very impressed when this thing comes on on the 7th. Any recommendations from you guys?",t2_87xipzu4

Xbox Series X seems to be outselling Playstation 5 in Brazil,"
The pre orders for XSX and XSS only started yesterday (Sep-29) in Brazil. PS5 pre orders, on the other hand, started at the same world-wide date (Sep-17) here.

After 12 days PS5s are not sold out yet in any of the top 3 national retailers. And several retailers are now giving 5-10% discounts. [ps5_link](https://www.americanas.com.br/produto/1838061077/console-playstation-5-ps5), [ps5_link2](https://m.pontofrio.com.br/console-playstation-5-controle-sem-fio-dualsense-55010438.html)

About 24 hours after launch, XSX sold out in 2 of those 3 largest retailers. [xsx_link1](https://www.americanas.com.br/produto/2116373642/console-xbox-series-x-1tb), [xsx_link2](https://m.pontofrio.com.br/console-xbox-series-x-1tb-controle-sem-fio-preto-55014095.html) 

Amazon (which is new in the country) still have XSXs available, and lists XSX and XSS as the 2 best selling items in its ""Games and Consoles"" category, with the PS5 in 4th position.

PS.: Before you envy us for still being able to buy both consoles on launch day, take into consideration the fact we have one  of the “world’s most expensive consoles”, at R$4.999, which is close to double the $499 US price, due to insane import taxes.

Xbox Game Pass needs more new sport games to become the complete package,"Game Pass is starting to become an absolute force for gaming. It is adding games that I never thought would be added to a service like this, at least at this point in time. Easily the best deal in gaming. However, there are a lot of gamers that primarily play sports games (NBA 2k, madden, Fifa, NHL, etc) and this really is a portion of the market that game pass hasn't hit yet.  Adding EA access is a great start. A lot of the older games will now be available, but how about those that want to play newer sports games?


At first I thought this was unlikely purely due to the fact that so many people buy these games already, what incentive is there to add them. However, most of these games are now so micro transaction heavy (which I hate) that I could see them putting the game on gamepass to get more traffic through the game and therefore more microtransactions.


Overall, one of the few genre's that is really underrepresented on game pass are sports titles, and bringing the new 2k, madden, Fifa, etc to the service would cement it as a must have in just about every gamer's household. Hopefully these games aren't neglected from the plans for the future of game pass.",t2_7ti6w

Atmos vs. Standard DD 5.1,"I recently got an audio setup that supports Dolby Atmos, so I was excited to test it out (I know only a select list of games have Atmos support).

What I’ve noticed is when I set the audio output to Atmos in the system settings, for SOME games that don’t support Atmos, this actually results in no longer getting 5.1 surround at all (meaning no sounds from rear channels).  I have to manually go back and switch the settings to regular DD 5.1 for some games to get 5.1 surround.

I was under the impression that even if a game doesn’t support Atmos, as long as it supports regular DD 5.1, it should flow through without having to change the settings, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.

Anyone else have this experience?

My example and how I tested...

Settings to Dolby Atmos then:
Booted up Forza Horizon 4 (which supports Atmos)&gt; 5.1 surround no problem.
Booted up Wolfenstein 2 (doesn’t support Atmos) &gt; I DON’T get surround at all.

Switch settings to Dolby 5.1 then:
Booted up Wolfenstein 2 &gt; 5.1 surround is back.

Switching the settings isn’t the end of the world, but I’m just curious if anyone else is experiencing this?",t2_6f7jpnls

Xbox system update crashes at 21%,"Hello
I've got a huge problem. My Xbox One X requires a 567MB system update right at the power up sequence. The thing is, it always crashes at 21%. I've tried everything, even tried with my cellphone as a network hotspot and that didn't worked.

I'm pretty desperate, it's been 3 days so I don't think it's their servers either.

My 4-month-old Elite 2 controller's right bumper isn't working unless I press down firmly right in the middle. Microsoft only offers a 90-day warranty. :/,"I bought an Elite 2 controller from Costco back in late May, so just over 4 months ago. 

Last week I noticed the right bumper wasn't registering fully, and it's continued to get worse. Sometimes it's totally fine, but other times I have to press down firmly right in the middle and outward areas don't register at all. This has been hugely frustrating in Warzone, as trying to throw C4 etc. has sometimes not worked responsively.

Microsoft only offers a 90-day warranty of course (sooo ridiculous that a $180 controller is only covered that amount of time!) but I'm hoping Costco will honor it. Thing is, I don't even know if they still stock them (it was an online exclusive at the time).

I was looking at homemade DIY repairs and someone said rubbing alcohol can help sticky buttons (in case it's actually sticky and not broken), but another person said it can damage the internal battery... does anyone know if I'd be OK pouring a tiny bit of rubbing alcohol along the corners? Any other suggestions?

   * This may require subscriptions to additional services such as XBox Gold (such as for cloud save transfers)
* **This IS a separate application/game on PlayStation 5** and trophies, stats and saves will not transfer

&gt; Currently on Xbox, all progress can be carried over between generations. On PlayStation, your Playgrounds creations can be carried over, but other game progress (Career, currency, saved liveries) cannot. If that changes, we'll let you know!

As you can see, its a much more seamless implementation that Xbox treats the game as one copy whereas PS5 treats it as a totally separate game and is required to do more work.",t2_i0gk9
"EA Play, back then Access issue.","Hello! I bought about 1 1/2 months ago EA Access for a discount for FIFA 21. When I bought EA Access it had a discount so I decided to get it. When it asked me to enter a credit card I did it and everything was fine. I think it was 30 pesos (Mexican Currency). The following day, my sister asks why there was a 30 pesos charge from Microsoft to the credit card I entered. Has anybody gone through this before? And how can I prevent it? I want to buy it to try Madden with my family and get the 10 hour trial for FIFA 21 but I'm scared they can charge more. Thanks a lot

Xbox One S controller very poor range issue,"I have recently fixed an Xbox controller because it was broken. I had to replace the power board (the one where you plug the batteries in).

The tester showed a lot of lag and wrong commands. I also tried it with my PC, via Bluetooth, and basically same thing. 

After updating the controller via wired connection, the problem remains. Also, I don't have an actual Xbox to test it.

I've pre-ordered the XSX and am excited to rejoin the Xbox world.

Xbox one S random beeping sounds from system while turned off,"Hey there!

I just wanna make sure that it's not something bad. Also if this get some answers I will post a video or some kind of link to a audio clip of the beeping on 20+ db so it can be heard, also sometimes the beeping sounds like a siren but after like 1-3 hours the beeping is gone. After some small research I've read it's maybe the hard drive or caused due to instant on, also seems like hearing beeps causes the console to not be able to turn on, but I've never had a problem since this beeping started, and I've already had this thing fixed once because it wouldn't display anything, but that was before the beeping.",t2_7wgz88g3

Achievements syncing extremely slow and it's my capping download speed.,"I normally play offline and then the next time I go online my achievements ""pop"" when I log-in, but the last few times they are taking absolutely ages, meaning it's ridiculous to try and download or update anything as for some reason it caps my speed to 45mbps while it's trying to sync. When it's finished I can finally download at full speed (200mbps), but it's taking about 30mins to sync a few achievements.

Which, when I just want to pop on and download a game it's ridiculous, I have to was half and hour before I can even use my Xbox properly.

Is there anyway I can force my Xbox to sync my achievements faster? As it never use to be this slow, it's always use to finish syncing within the first 5 minutes.",t2_2b3mroc5

"""X took too long to start""","Hey guys, I've been having a problem on One S for the past couple months now. I've looked in the tech support post and saw that some people have the same issues BUT all of the fixes that have worked for them have done nothing for me so I was hoping if anyone has any other suggestions.. I'm willing to try almost anything at this point.

So here's the issue: NBA 2K20 was working perfectly fine for a few months but up until around May/June iirc the game was beginning to freeze at certain spots. Eventually, this led to the infamous ""X took too long to start"" error. I had believed this to be exclusively a fault with the game itself but soon it started to affect the rest of the console. 
It began with Monster Hunter: World but restarting my console would make MH:W work again. It then spread to FIFA 20 as well and when this happened that's when it really got out of control. Essentially all my games eventually couldn't start except for like Skate 3 which I found strange 😂 

Also on top of most of my games breaking, my Xbox also runs extremely slowly to the point that the scrolling sound on the dashboard sounds like a Transformer. 

So my question, other than if anyone has any solutions, would be is it possible for the actual NBA 2K20 disc to be causing these issues? I tested this on my brother's Xbox as well, also a One S, and it caused the same issues so that's why I now suspect the game itself. 

So some more information that might be relevant to troubleshooting and maybe help someone going through the same:
https://windowsreport.com/took-too-long-to-start-xbox-one-error/

As of today I've officially exhausted every solution on the list and then some. I've re-installed the game online, offline, with the latest update, without the latest update, I've reset to factory settings many times (both keeping games and apps and deleting everything), cleared reserved space, persistent storage, changed my location,, turned instant-on off etc. I think you get the point lol

Umm so it seems okay when I uninstall 2K so I feel confident that it was the game. I'm not convinced it's the disc because when 2K was on Game Pass and I installed it without the disc it still did the same. Is it possible for a game to (effectively) brick a console like this because I was under the assumption that corrupted saved data and files causes this error so I'm really confused.

ANY help would be greatly appreciated!",t2_3m62crs5

Does an Xbox One Series X or S make more sense in my use case?,"I currently have an Xbox One X that I don't play as much anymore. The reason is that I built a gaming pc last year that's not too shabby. (Ryzen 2600X and RTX 2070 with 16GB of ram on an SSD). My main use of the Xbox is for games not available on PC, like Kingdom Hearts III, and for games I already bought before I built my PC and did not want to buy again.

I mostly game on a 1080p 144hz monitor, though 80% the games I play are not high fps, and intensive enough to run between 70-120fps. Occasionally I game on my Samsung 4K TV due to the niceness of easier couch gaming without the Steam casting. However due to my specs, I have to reduce most settings to medium and some to low to maintain a 60fps average (without true sync like my monitor's). That being said, the TV is 60hz (Samsung NU8000 50"" I got a couple years back). I have no intention of buying a new TV. For the record I have a subscription to Game Pass Ultimate.

Currently Gamestop offers $200 when trading in an Xbox One X, meaning the Series S would cost about $100 and the X about $300. For the 1080p 144hz and 4K 60hz on average, which of the two would make most sense? Ideally I'd like to save as much as possible. I don't really care about super high framerate on my monitor since I plan to upgrade my GPU as needed. But I do want a stable 60fps on my 60hz 4K tv without much of a compromise/dip.

Honest question: Will Microsoft buy or is about to buy Thq Nordico / Embracer Group? READ DESCRIPTION !!,"I wonder if it is Thq Nordic for different points:

&amp;#x200B;

* They have published many games on Gamepass and Live.
* In the Embracer group report they make it very clear that their business model will be to work with subscriptions and cloudgaming services.
* They are buying studios, IPs and publishers as if they are working on something big in the short term.
* Phil Spencer recently went to visit the Nordic lands, it is not known if it was for Cyberpunck or for something else.
* And on twitter it is one of the favorites, just search for #Thq and you will see that many think this.

  
Edit: There is also another point, but this may make little sense because I am ignorant about the matter. In July or August they reported on the Embracer group page that they had $ 1.5B (Country currency) in issuance of shares that would help them work in the short and long term in business and purchase more studios, and ... I can't stop to think that's weird ...

Does Microsoft still have a chance against Sony?,"Units Sold / Marketshare:

* WW1 (Xbox vs PS2): 24m vs 155m = 179m total (13% vs. 87%)
* WW2 (X360 vs. PS3): 84m vs 87m = 171m total (49% vs. 51%)
* WW3 (X1 vs. PS4): 50m vs 112m = 162m (31% vs. 69%)

I'm really hoping Microsoft wins WW4 between the value they offer, the power of their technology, and their overall consumer-friendly practices.  I honestly think it would be #1 if it weren't for the very turbulent X1 launch, which it largely corrected but it was too late, and exclusive titles that Sony has signed. 

I love the Xbox controller and ecosystem.  It's all very user-friendly and present amazing value to the consumer.  Microsoft consistently comes up with new ideas (like GWG, backwards compat, etc.) that Sony tries to replicate but never pulls off.  Microsoft deserves a win.",t2_ey26l

I finally played Gears 5 while I was home sick.,"I finished Gears 5's campaign today and I justed needed to say that whether or not I go the Xbox Series X or PS5 route (still undecided) I had a blast.  

I've been with the franchise since the start. I even grew up in the city where it was developed (I had a signed copy of Gears of War 3 back home as well, from a midnight release where some developers were doing a signing at a local Gamestop).  Gears of War was the co-op shooter my friends and I played in between Halo releases. We would go through the campaign at scheduled times so no one got left behind and when we beat the story we would play endless rounds of horde and try and beat wave 50 on each map, some nights we were up until 3 am (for reference I was 17 in highschool when 3 came out).  

When Gears of War 4 came out I was excited to get back on and clear it with my friends, but unfortunately they had all grown tired of the series. So me and my younger beat it together and I stuck around for a bit of multiplayer and horde for a bit, no where near as much as 2 or 3.  It was the ultimate experience I had when I was a kid but I appreciated my brother tagging along even if he had no investment to the story or anything. 

So by the time Gears 5 came out I was hesitant to play it, since my brother now lives in a different time zone and doesn't play online as much anymore either.  I had Game pass so I downloaded it. Got in a match of horde just see how it looked and felt. Yup felt like Gears alright.  Then I played the story and stopped about halfway through the second act.  I just wasn't feeling it.  And I pretty much put it out of my mind all together. 

Then this weekend I got a mild cold and couldn't work the last few days.  I figured I could use some action and melodrama so I decided to boot up Gears 5 and sink my teeth in.

I beat it in less then a couple days but what a ride. The story was pretty good honestly, I didn't really appreciate swapping protagonists after only one game in the new trilogy but I ended up preferring Kait over JD overall, she's just something different for the series and her motivation was interesting enough to get me hooked. 

Now while I liked the story, I loved the moments of sheer spectacle.  There were times when I would drop my jaw when I certain scene would happen.  I haven't felt so tiny in a videogame since Halo 2 verses the Scarab.  And I wasn't just tiny, I was the scrappy Outsider on a mission. I was pretty immersed I'd say.  The visuals and sound design, just outstanding. 

But the gameplay, the most I've ever clicked in a Gears of War game.  Using Jack's abilities allowed me to change it up and figure out new tactics.  There were so many hairpin moments where one shot and one second decided whether or not I was going to be a splatter on the screen, and when I pulled it off, just fantastic.  Or when I was using the GL Lancer and managed to get 4-5 drones in one shot during an intense fight. So satisfying.  And that's the other thing every firefight was tense and after each one it only ramped up and up.  Oh and the boss fight in act 2, I died countless times but eventually when I overcame it I got that sigh of relief that I honestly haven't had with a game for a while.  This game made me feel like a kid again going, ""what the fuck?!"" like I did when I was in highschool with my friends. 

I didn't care too much for the open world. I liked the side objectives alright, nothing memorable, the component parts kept me checking every nook and cranny, and the skiff when it got up to speed was really fun to drive, but it felt too empty and padding to validate it being there.  You could've kept the linear level design and maybe had an optional side mission you could either ignore or do along the route and it'll bring you back to where you were, but I guess they were just following trends or something.  

I gotta say I didn't expect to write a full review like this before 10pm, but I was just surprised how much I actually enjoyed this game.  I look back on the series fondly but when I'm away from it I usually just think of it as ""The big dudes shoot at the ugly dude behind a well placed wall"" and kinda just write it off.  But when I'm actually playing it, I get it.  It is definitely just like I described but it's got more to it then I remembered and I'm glad I got this cold so I could play it.  Whether or not I stick with Xbox or not this was a good game to finish this generation on.

Edit: I wrote this on mobile and now my thumbs are sore...",t2_iuvj7

Why 4K-60FPS must be the new standard?,"I would make this as clear as possible, when you tell your developers their game must support 4K 60 FPS, you actually telling them to lower the graphics specs of the game. (As long as its not an indie game)

To run a game on 4k 60FPS you need a really strong Computer, and I know the Xbox series X is pretty strong but still not enough.

People need to understand that a game can look a lot better on 1080P 60FPS than 4k 60 FPS and even 4k 30 fps sometimes , because there are other aspects of graphics other than resolution...

This statement of almost everything needs to support ""4K 60 FPS"" will make games look about the same as now as we play them on our current generation consoles with the difference of them running 4K on the new consoles. That's wrong.",t2_jkkuzsz

I'm not talking about IGN or Gamespot or other, big websites that break news and such; I'm talking more about individuals on social media that give their quick takes but still produce quality content at the same time. Where it's not the same information you could find elsewhere. 

One example would be someone like Brad Sams who is on YouTube and just drops the news and gives his thoughts on it. He is specific to Microsoft products of all kinds but I still enjoy him for his Xbox takes. Another is ReviewTechUSA who has a few videos throughout the day and then has a livestream at night where he just fields questions via chats. 

Surely there are more people like this and these are just two that I've found after getting an interest back in gaming after nearly a decade away from it.

I received mine this morning and it’s making a high pitched noise that I haven’t been able to stop through troubleshooting so I’d like to get it repaired. However, I’m going round in circles on their website trying to find warranty or contact info to send it back. I’ve contacted Xbox support on Twitter and am waiting for a reply,  but if anyone can point me in the direction of a working website link or email address it’d be much appreciated. Thanks :)

CoD: Coldwar question,"Hey guys. Pre-ordered the Series X and I'm going to get cod in November because it looks pretty good and the wife and I love some zombies. Currently we do the thing where I play on my One X downstairs and then do the gameshare thing so she can play on a One S upstairs.

When I download the game when it releases on my new Series X, will I be able to download it through my account on the One X so she can play, or is the Series X version a different download?

Basically, will I have to buy the game for the Series X and for the One X in order for us to play together, or will the gameshare option still work?

Thanks!",t2_pq746ny

"I heard a rumor that the Devs are a little more active in paying attention to the customers wants more than the PS4 devs. Is this true, and could you possibly link me to examples?","Life has pulled me from Xbox, but if this is true, I would much rather migrate my library for an even slightly improved user experience. 

(More about me and my experience. TL;DR's by the paragraph) 

**TL;DR** - Don't choose a system based off what other people have. If they actually play the same games as you, they probably don't have the time to. 

I think it's been about five years since I switched. At the time I had a bunch of co-workers and a few friends on the  PlayStation side when I decided to go with the crowed. Since then, I've spent maybe 5% of my play time playing with other PlayStation users. 


**TL;DR** -  My games aren't proprietary and people sound better muted


The overall experience has been rather bland to be honest. The community is pretty toxic in the games I play based on the majority of interactions. (If you didn't know already, I'm absolute garbage and my mother is a very social woman.) I mainly play Apex, RocketLeague, and lately I've really enjoyed Ancestors The Humankind Odyssey. Other than that the games I play really aren't exclusive to the platform. 


**TL;DR** - Entertainment apps are slow and the overall UI feels so cumbersome

The UI is as impractical today as it was the day I got the console. You can group games into folders, but you can't take certain apps out of the entertainment folder. It takes about - okay I timed it. It took exactly 54.26 seconds and 4 to 5 clicks from the home screen just to  open Netflix. NETFLIX dude. YouTube is double the clicks because it's positioned further away in the folder of ""Can't Take It Out"". This might sound ridiculous, but I've at so many cold dinners just trying to set up a movie I *want* to watch. Call me crazy, but I don't remember Xbox's home screen being so insanely difficult. 


**TL;DR** - Partying up is easily 10x harder than I remember Xbox being. 

""Starting a party? Sure! Lemme just create the room..........okay I..... I think that's it............oh wait! I gotta invite the person hah, my fault!"" - PS4

My console doesn't speak in the ""traditional sense"", but you get the idea. 


**TL;DR** - If you think you have memory, think again. 

It is entirely possible to have a significant amount of storage left that would more than cover the size of a games update, BUT apparently you have to be able to load up TWICE the amount of complete storage the game requires or something like that simply because, 
""That's how it is."" - SONY rep
This meant that in order to update Red Dead Redemption, or Call of Duty MW; I needed to have about 150-200gb free at all times. Luckily I got the terabyte console to house these games on! 
""Just buy the disc!"" That is a wonderful idea, except RDR2 *is* a disc.  
I feel cheated out of multiple titles. I didn't mention Starwars Battlefront because I got it in the free game of the month offer. 


**TL;DR** - The controller sucks ass. 


**TL;DR** - Gameplay recoding is far superior on Xbox 

I've since gotten used to this, but damn I miss remembering how much better clipping gameplay was on Xbox... Have they made improvements? Tell me about the rabbits...



Okay, I think I've said enough. There's some more I look for that I'm not getting into, but my update finally downloa- alright it still has to install. 


Here's my question to budget gamers: Do you think buying an Xbox one will still be a reasonable purchase after the new generation releases?

Can't play Destiny 2 on same network with other Xbox,"Been tearing my hair out over this issue reading countless forum and reddit posts, trying all suggestions without success and I'm about at my limit.

Hardware:

Modem: Arris SB8200

Router: Netgear Nighthawk AC1750 (R6700v3)

Xbox One X (x2)


The problem:

My room mate and I can play together just the two of us in a fireteam for hours without issue, but if we bring a friend into the fireteam and attempt to do an activity, one of us will get booted, every time.

Some other interesting details present are:

- In the Xbox friends list, I appear offline to him even though I'm not set to Appear Offline.

- Given the above, if he sends me an invite to anything, I won't get it, but, I can send him invites, and he does get it.


What I've tried:

- Automatic IPs, UPnP enabled = can't play at all without being disconnected almost immediately with a wide assortment of Bungie error codes (beaver, eel, etc)

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled = same result

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled, + putting one Xbox in DMZ = same result

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled + IPv6 enabled = we can play without issue


At this stage, I should mention, within the Xbox Advanced Network settings, we both have Open NATs, differently assigned port numbers, and show IPv4 &amp; IPv6 in use.


Now, when we attempt playing with others in the fireteam, my NAT remains Open while the other Xbox gets a Moderate NAT (and as mentioned, one of us will get booted after starting an activity).


To try and solve this, I tried:

- Disabling UPnP, reset router, Re-enabling UPnP, reset router again, then reset modem, and both Xbox's = same issue

- Disabling UPnP, enable port forwarding for ports 88, 500, 3074, 3544, and 4500 on one system, and 89, 501, 3075, 3544, and 4501 on the other, reset everything like above = same result


This should NOT be necessary at all to get two systems working.  Almost every help topic I come across about this mentions how Bungie is a clueless pos when it comes to networking so, I'm confident it IS on their end (and maybe some of XBL too given what I mentioned about appearing offline and invites not working), but, clearly some people can make it work with all these fixes, and others make it work with no configuration at all.


Things I've not tried yet:

- Getting a 2nd IP from Comcast (from what I understand this should definitively fix the issue)

- Getting a different router


I'm not sure a 2nd IP is available to me, that's something I need to call about, but if it's not available then...

As for another router, what I'd love to know is, for those with multiple Xbox's who play Destiny 2 together without any extra configuration, what is the router that you're using?  I want it.

Any help with this is appreciated!",t2_5fbf4cz

"Good news for external HDD users, great news for external SSD users.","[https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1310571820999823362?s=20](https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1310571820999823362?s=20)

The load times for legacy games off a USB SSD are nearly on par with loading off the internal NVMe SSD.  It's *under a second* difference when loading Assassin's Creed Origins.   This shows that backwards compatible games don't need to be taking up valuable internal space to be played with the really quick loads.

&amp;#x200B;

Why isn't there much difference between the internal SSD and an external SSD?  It's probably because the processing of data off the drive is the real bottleneck.

&amp;#x200B;

This is explored in the [Ars Technica preview](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/xbox-series-x-hands-on-the-big-back-compat-dive-begins/) where they loaded off a USB mechanical drive with the Series X and also achieved very significant gains.

A story behind the new Flight Sim Japan Update trailer,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalJaTmv-TY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalJaTmv-TY)

A trailer for Flight Sim Japan Update was re-uploaded a few hours ago to celebrate its launch and to reflect some feedback regarding a political controversy.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima\_Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima_Island)

In the original video released during TGS, there was a scene with Hashima Island, a.k.a ""*Warship* Island"", a small island that were originally developed as a coal mine. During WWII, the island became a sort of 'labor camp', as Korean and Chinese civilians and prisoners were sent to the island to work at the mine under very harsh condition. 

After the initial trailer was uploaded, people immediately complained about the place being introduced as a 'beautiful scenery'. As exotic and beautiful as it may appear from the sky above, it represents a painful war memory for the survivors from the labor camp that are still alive to this day.

Microsoft told South Korean media 5 days ago that they were sorry and the trailer would be updated to remove the scene. [https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=110559](https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=110559) (a link for a Korean news article)

Is that correct? Is there anyway for me to add an Xbox account so his Switch and Xbox progress are maintained together at this point? I am at a loss and would appreciate any suggestions.",t2_ve5ln
How to upload in one shot!,"I have a bunch of captures uploaded to Xbox live, apparently I can’t trim because it says they’re not on my Xbox unsure how they got removed, also the trim tool isnt working...

XSX is the most quiet Xbox ever,"""I'll conclude this preview with the best news to come out of this venting weirdness: Series X, so far, is the quietest Xbox I've ever tested. Back-compat software runs the Series X to a high enough level to activate the fans and unleash noticeable heat dissipation, but I can barely hear it, even while spending hours in current-gen, open-world romps like Destiny 2 and Red Dead Redemption 2. Will that change when we get higher-performing ""next-gen"" games to test? That question, and many more, will have to wait until next time.""

That's amazing. The form factor really pays off.",t2_10ntnjy8

Xbox One Recordings: It is a case of luck,"Hi Guys,

I believe that there are dozens of posts about this but all of them suggests the same full power reset which doesn't always solve the problem.

The biggest disappointment with my current Xbox One X even with S is when you have that awesome kill, hit record, go check it later and all you have is a 6s video. The same applies to external storage which enables 1h recording.  
To try to avoid that, I always hit record like 2-4 times to make sure it will save.  


I believe I have tried everything:

* Full power reset. I always turn off/full power off the console, then turn off the wall socket - Australia power socket
* USB stick 3.0, good one
* External  Toshiba 128GB USB 3.0 mSATA  \~380MB/s
* External Silicon Power 1TB NVMe PCIe USB 3.0 storage which used to be my main storage and crazy fast loading. But the console would freak out sometimes which recently I discover it has to be an NGFF SATA so I went back to my WD 3TB USB 3.0 where all my games are stored and played from  \~480MB/s
* I've tried different USB ports from the console
* Even recording to the console which limits you to 2min, you end up with 6s videos.

I don't wanna spend thousands with captures devices, I am not a bloody YouTuber haha  
I don't wanna lose my 4K HDR TV either, the majority of the devices limit the output to 1080p

My recording setting is set to 1080p. I have even tried 720p before and still.

Is there anyone with an up to do date solution for this annoying issue?

Thanks a lot guys",t2_4d6mk7x6

Because the airpods connect to the iPad it works really well. When I was able to switch to the TV to keep playing, I just plugged my iPad in and use the TV screen to play.

Now I’m getting the same error codes from E105 to now E100 after endless attempts to reset the Xbox to factory setting and do an offline update via USB (it fails at step 3 for some reason).

Xbox 360 games not working online with main account,"Ever since Sunday, my xbox 360 games on Xbox One have been saying that I don't have my gamer profile logged in and that I need to log in to one. I already was, but oh well. I select mine, and it says that this account doesn't have a Xbox Live subscription, and I need to download it again. What the hell, I renewed it Friday. I pick the other account and it works fine. What is happening? Is this because I use my main account more often, like a lot more often? I've tried restarting the console, I've tried deleting the games. This only happens with Xbox 360 games, however. Also, I should mention I changed my gamertag recently as well, if that helps",t2_65s9l090

Game Pass (Console) includes XBLG?,"Okay, I am very new to Xbox (Playstation transfer, they lost my love with PS5 crap)  and I already love it! 

My main question is does Game Pass Console include XBL Gold as well, or do I have to stay with Game Pass Ultimate to keep the bundle plan??? I've read around that things changed in the past year, but I want the veteran XB players views and thoughts. 

I am looking for the best 1 year subscription plan, either stay with Gamepass Ultimate and charge $360 once, or buy XBL 1 year instead.

My og XB1 isn't reading my external hardrive,I even bought a new hdmi 3.0 because I thought it was the usb that was the issue but now I think it's the usb port itself that's the problem because the issue where the console doesn't read the hardrive is still ongoing.

Don't think buying a new hardrive would solve the issue as I said the problem looks like it's the port itself...,t2_46l4kikh

Does this mean my XOne X is broken?,"I was playing theHunter, and suddenly my screen went to black, and then showed I've no signal. I tried all the common things like hard reset (holding the power + eject buttons for 10 seconds, switching HDMI cables, TV's, nothing worked)

The other options were very difficult, opening the console up and messing around with the HDD (like switching with another one to see if that's the cause of the issue) and HDMI ports (soldering stuff scares me)

I then got 1 more idea before going deep. I saw people recommending changing settings to people who have TV disconnection issues, like Bit 10 to 8 and shit which obviously I couldn't do because I have no signal.

So then, I thought maybe I could stream my Xbox to my laptop and it works!

So my question is, does this mean the HDMI port is the definitive issue? So far, all settings I've tried didn't help, are there any more specific settings I could try before giving up?

I haven't tried doing a factory reset, will it delete my saved games etc?

Any help will be appreciated guys, this console was my pandemic savior, now all I'm left with is a shitty laptop.",t2_874m4ogs
Questions for those that have played NBA 2K21 or Madden 21?,"I've been debating on buying the new Madden and NBA games, but everything I read says they are horrible. For those that have played, are they really that bad? Is it just a copy and paste of last year's editions or have they gotten worse?

For 2k, I know the shot stick has changed drastically, but how bad is this game? I looked up user reviews and read generally horrid reviews with an average rating of about 1.5/5.

I still enjoy playing NBA 2K20 (my career/my league) mostly, but am wondering if I am better off just sticking to 20 until patches come out and the rookie class is added. 

As for Madden, I'm hesitant because nothing I've seen looks any different from last year. I've seen countless glitch plays instead of highlights and the field mode, while exciting, wouldn't compel me to purchase it for solely that mode. 


Tl;dl: Asking for a general review if you've played madden 21 or nba 2k21. Do you enjoy them? Are they as bad as everyone is saying?",t2_3bn9qpr7

Xbox All Access Pre-Order,"I see there are a lot on here that like me, were allowed to apply for Xbox All Access, get approved, get a line of credit, and get denied a console. I also know there are many that haven't received any email even though this happened to them as well.

I've been making a lot of noise on Twitter for the last 6 days. MS sent emails stating that they were working on a solution, Gamestop is promising pre-orders to those affected through their site.

MS support emailed me stating there is no plan yet, and closed my ticket.

I'm hoping MS and Gamestop do the right thing here, but with the exception of the email there has not been any communication, and no public acknowledgement.

I have been trying to get IGN, Gamespot, Polygon, Kotaku, etc. to pick up the story. Eurogamer published a story about the same thing happening in the UK. I think that if the story got picked up by one of these US sites, it could put the pressure on MS and Gamespot to do the right thing and follow through.

Dramatic? Maybe...but I care about my credit quite a bit and this whole thing is really leaving a sour taste in my mouth. I want Microsoft to do better. I want them to fix this broken system so this doesn't happen again.

Please, if you can, reach out to these media outlets and tell them your story. It may help, and at this point couldn't hurt all of our chances. We need more visibility.",t2_tajqr

Looking to get my first ever console, XSS that is. I do have some questions/concerns and I hope one of you could help me!

- is it safe buying the first batches (2020) or are there usually build quality imperfections?

A crossover game but more horde style?,"I’ve been seeing a lot of rosters for a smash-style game or Mario kart rip-off and have been wondering why not make it horde style in which you fend off against enemy armies from across the games (like covenant, flood and forerunner from halo, locusts from gears, and demons from doom, etc...)which each protagonist having their unique FPS or third person shooting mechanics.

What I mean by unique styles is like master chief having his op guns and bases but can’t hide behind cover and is first person while Marcus is third person and can blind fire but is more around using cover mechanics and doom slayer just runs around blasting, they can even extend this to have like ori being small and having little health but can move quickly and they can even have those orbs he uses to blink through around the map so he can get behind cover. Or have corvo/ Elizabeth as stealth users to sneak up on enemies, ofc there is going to need to be a lot of balancing but I can see this working or at least being far better than copying a Nintendo game with obvious backlash to come with.

Fable 3 co op,"So I just recently downloaded Fable 3 onto my Xbox one to start playing again. I had progressed through the story up until I have to meet Ben Finn outside the Bowerstone Castle. My friend decided he wanted to play as well, so we made him an account and progressed him to about Brightwood. I jumped in to his account with my own separate profile (Outside Bowerstone Castle) but then I had left the session without signing out or turning off my controller. Once he had gone into the Reliquary it had auto saved, but it didn’t make either one of us think twice. He said he wanted me to join, so I did (again). This time I joined as an exact copy of him (in Dweller gear and only 23 Guild Seals). I was extremely confused and went to load my Bowerstone Castle save only to see it overwritten? I can’t load it because it’s the one I’m on. 
I ended the session and logged into my game only to be right where we logged him out and I’m still his exact copy.

I DO however see a lot of good replacement faceplates for the 1698 model, which is the original elite controller. I know that there is the hole for the profile switch in the middle, but besides that, would that faceplate work on a 1697 controller?

I know there are discrepancies like not being able to use the “scuf rings” to hotswap the thumb sticks (which I don’t even have on the right as it blocks my kontrol freek) and the hole in the middle, but as long as I can screw it in and it will be a compatible fit I will be happy. I just don’t feel like spending $170 on a series 2 controller because of the faceplate (especially considering i copped 2 series x’s for me and family). And I’ve taken apart the controller many times and also replaced the bumpers, so I’m trying to squeeze all the life out of this one first lol.

"With Xbox/Microsoft now owning Bethesda I strongly believe they should pull the Skyblivion crew into actual business, give them support they need and then launch Skyblivion as an official remaster of Oblivion.","I know this idea might rub some people the wrong way, and you could technically make the argument that it's an ""add-on mod"" for Skyrim right now, but my point is for years I've watched the small crew of Skyblivion devs work their magic and truly give Oblivion a much needed and appreciated make-over.

I think now that Xbox has Bethesda, they should look at what the Skyblivion guys are doing, draw them into the fold as part of Bethesda officially, but let them continue doing what they want and then re-launch Oblivion as a remaster using what they've done.

Obviously I am not talking about just taking their work. I mean bring them into the fold as a dev team doing this Oblivion update *on the side* to the rest of Bethesda. 

To me, it's a no-brainer. Bethesda has already re-done Skyrim a few times, but why not bring in the Skyblivion people and let them do Oblivion *officially* now, giving them the money and resources to pull it all off, definitively?

TES:VI is probably 4-5 years away at least. In the meantime, we already have the Skyblivion people doing wonderful things to Oblivion, so launching it as the ""official"" Oblivion remaster in the meantime would actually be an amazing idea to hold people over until TES:VI and one thing's for sure a official Oblivion ""remaster"" in the meantime as an exclusive would help establish the Elder Scrolls series as Xbox's now-current crown jewel.

Do you think Best Buy will reserve/honor a console for those who signed up All-Access like Gamestop and MS?,"Hi everyone, I've just joined this sub and I'm super excited for the Series S and X to drop this fall! I can't wait to be back in the xbox family (hopefully) soon.

I have a question that's similar to what I'm sure a lot of other people have had, and I've been hoping to get some sort of update but I can't get a reliable answer from either Citizens One, Microsoft, or Best Buy. I tried to preorder the Series S through Best Buy last week, and I was able to get all my info in for All-Access, but I was kicked out of process before I could successfully order a console. Now, I have an approved line of credit from Citizens One with nothing to use it on, and no idea how I would go about applying it if and when pre-orders come back before launch (I'm guessing we could use the account number?). 

I know MS and Gamestop have realized the predicament this puts a lot of people who signed up for all-access in, and they've reached out to customers, but Best Buy (and I believe also Wal-Mart, unless I missed an update), have been silent on the issue so far. With that in mind, I was wondering if you guys had heard anything from Best Buy, or if right now my only course of action is just to hope I can secure a console before my line of credit is closed from inactivity. 

Thank you guys so much, and one way or another I'm excited to be back on xbox soon!!",t2_16rpds
Xbox System Updates,"The one thing where I think PS4 has the advantage (apart from their great exclusive games for now) is the way they handle system updates.

I got booted off my game to update my system. PS4 does this in the background and lets you know when it's ready to install, so you can do this at your own leisure. Why can't Xbox do this?

Pretty hard to build fable 4 hype when fable 2 on gamepass is broken,"In order to get fable 2 on Xbox one to work without freezing every 5-20 minutes (once you get it past freezing on the game’s  main menu screen) you can run it offline which apparently fixes it. however not all of us have our home Xbox’s readily available, so the game won’t work in offline mode.

Looking for RPGs with good writing and a blankish-slate main character,"I like well-written RPGs with a protagonist whose name and backstory aren't pre-determined. I'm willing to allow *some* leeway on that. The KOTOR games, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Dragon Age: Origins and Inquisition give your character a vague backstory, but you can sort of play around that. You aren't locked into a particular role.

I also prefer a darker tone to a goofy one. The more roleplaying opportunity, the better.

Aside from the games mentioned above, here are some other games that I have really enjoyed that fit what I'm looking for in some way or another:

The Baldur's Gate Saga

Pathfinder: Kingmaker

Pillars of Eternity

Neverwinter Nights

Obviously I'm open to games with different playing styles, but I tend really not to like the arcade/MMORPG style of Inquisition, even though I thought it had a great story. For the best combo of writing and gameplay, I would take the writing of F:NV and the gameplay of FO4, although I think that the writing of FO4 is still pretty good. 

One game I'm considering is The Outer Worlds. It looks like it may be a tad goofier than I am normally attracted to, but if it's well-written, fun to play, and allows for some good roleplaying, then I'm open to giving it a chance. Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps popping up, but the story doesn't sound all that interesting to me. But who knows.

There is not a setting, AFAIK, that affects the in-game voice chat of each game. Individual games have their own settings for this, such as Destiny, to allow you play game voice chat through your speakers. If Fortnite has this option, I've never seen it.

You know what grinds my gear? The super tiny text in xbox one games.,"\*Start old man rant\* I got my xbox one s about a year ago, and one thing i noticed right away was how small the text is in the games. It is like these games were designed for you to sit 3 feet in front of your tv.

My living room layout, I have a 40"" 1080p tv, and I sit about 15 feet away on the sofa. Last generation games everything was fine, text was legible, graphics were good. Got a xbox one s, and now i have to sit 5 feet in front of the screen on the floor to be able to read the stats and status messages on the screen. 

Maybe my eyes are getting worse, or games are getting too text heavy that they need to cram a ton of text on the screen at once. I constantly have to tell my daughter not to sit so close to the screen. 

I have game pass, so I tried lots of games. Any game with stats and numbers, are super tiny. I enjoy ubisoft games, so maybe it is mostly ubisoft (watchdogs1,2, assassins creed, the division 1,2)

Controller is sent in for repairs. Can't use KBM without logging in with a controller first?,"So my warranty was almost up for my razer wolverine controller and it had a few issues that hugged me so I sent it back. Got about 2 weeks before my new one arrives and I thought this would be fine as xbox has a great selection of keyboard and mouse available games but there's a catch. You CANNOT log on to many of these games without a single input from a controller. A simple press of A is all you need then you can go about your merry keyboard and mouse adventures. So here I am with a  plethora of fully functioning devices and no ability to actually play. Just before any says as well sadly the companion apps on both computer and mobile don't have input functionality on the actual games just on the home screen and media apps. Any help would be amazing, or if by some miracle xbox somehow sees this you have multiple people unable to utilise their consoles because of a stupid reason. Thanks for your time.",t2_a1ocg
My xboxone disc drive is working but there is some fault in the code,"Hi, my xbox one disc drive is half dead.

Other than console streaming the Xbox beta app is worse than the old app,"It's missing several key features of the old, non beta app. These aren't just minor ""I'd like to have them"" features but huge things
 
The Store  is completely gimped with only like 3 categories, no New Releases or Upcoming Games sections, it doesn't even have a Redeem Code option. You can't even BUY games with it, no games have any price listed only the option to download it. It has zero discoverability for games, you have to search for pretty much every game by name if it's not in the one of the three categories they show

No way to view Achievements or monthly leaderboard

No way to view Clubs

No way to view Activity Feed

The Achievement, Clubs and Feed I'm not that concerned about but the Store being, essentially, useless is the real issue. No way to buy games, no discoverability and not even an option to redeem a code just makes the app completely pointless to me. I get it's a beta but why even release it in this state? It's not even a MVP (minimally viable product) since the Store is 100% useless as a store.",t2_2gu5fwm3

3 years of game pass for $181 ($5 month) for anyone that's never had gamepass before.,"I'm sure this has been posted several times but there are many opportunities to help people like me. I went to update my live gold to game pass and saw that my 2 months left would convert to gamepass time for free. I then did a quick Google search and found out I could carry up to 3 years, so I bought 3 one year digital codes off of Amazon for $180 then paid the $1 to upgrade to gamepass.

Will Microsoft ever make a true handheld gaming system like Nintendo or Sony? I kind of already know about the XCloud but I feel that is not a true handheld console. It would be pretty awesome to have one that is a dedicated handheld xbox console with its own operating system. I feel like the XCloud is just a cop out to not actually make a handheld system.

I've been on this sub so much, especially this month with the Series X preorder, but still somehow forgot my games. I know it should be so simple, but I never know the date and the first of the month just doesn't make me go ""Oh yeah, Games with Gold"". And then some come out midway through the month and same thing, it's just not something I remember.

Sometimes I notice on the Xbox tab, but I usually just voice command and go straight to Netflix.

XBOX fan and UI/UX Designer here,"Why the new XBOX STORE look so cheap and feel laggy as hell ? Navigation is awful, transition between games feel just broken, The global rectangular design is not respected and there is no logic in navigation.

I do not understand any changes made. When I look for a game among the deals for example, I only see 6 at a time, and everything is even slower than before. There is three layers of border on the item selected, 2/3 of my screen display useless information about the game I didn’t selected yet, everything feels just wrong. 

Did you feel the same thing? Am I the only one who cares about this kind of thing, so I shouldn't? I like my console and the system design created by Microsoft three years ago, but here I feel like I’m browsing in a failed imitation attempt, and it hurts.

Nothing was perfect, but it’s a step backwards in my opinion.",t2_3fvkz85
"All Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 replacements were broken, now says I'm out of warranty","I bought this Elite Controller Series 2 from Best Buy for $180. I noticed after a couple of weeks that the face buttons were unresponsive if you pressed them at certain angles. The button would be pressed, but it wouldn't register. It was maddening. Best Buy's return window was 15 days though and it was too late by the time I figured it out. : ( I sent it in to MS for replacement. 

I received a used controller with a half-dead RB button and left stick drift. This was worse than the first one!  I wish I hadn't sent it in. I sent that one back for replacement again. It took a while to get it back cause of COVID, which is understandable. 

I got my 3rd controller, and this one had a broken right-stick tensioner (it would not tighten up), intermittently working bottom-left paddle button, and has some trouble connecting to the PC occasionally. This is getting bad. 

I just logged on to begrudgingly send it back again, and says I'm out of warranty. I haven't had a fully-working controller from the start and now I'm left with one that doesn't always connect, and when it does, it has issues, which are surely going to compound. 

I know not everyone has these problems with their elite controllers, and I wish I was one of them, but this was not my experience.",t2_9sclr

The Series S and Series X maintain the same backwards compatibility with Xbox and 360 games that the Xbox One had and is 100% completely backwards compatible with every One game except Kinect games?

I thought of an idea for Microsoft/Playstation so physical games could be still relevant in the future,"Why not adapt the serial key design that PC uses on software in the past? The disc is used to install the game on the hardware and requires a serial key to activate on your account. The game converts into a digital game and the disc is no longer needed to play the game.

Applying the serial key is automatic as well. It's as easy as putting the disc in and it will ask the user if they want to tether this license to this account. 

If you want to lend a game to your friend, all your friend needs to do is to put that same disc into his console and will notify him that it's registered to another user and will deactivate the previous owner's copy and apply the license to him instead.

However; This method would probably involve an internet connection for physical games to be played and installed for the first time. Also ""legacy games"" aka xbox 360/xbox one disc games probably won't be able to implement such a feature.

It might be too late now but perhaps in the future?

"If you have a Xbox One X, you might want to hold off on upgrading to the Series X for about a year. Here's why:","Don't downvote me into oblivion just yet. Hear me out.

I'm *not* saying don't get the Series X. I currently have a One X and already have my pre-order for the Series X, after all. 

However, if you already have an Xbox One X like me, it might not be the upgrade you were expecting... yet.

Here's why:

- Only the newest TV's with HDMI 2.1 can take full advantage of the power of the Series X to display 4K at **120 fps** (and output uncompressed Dolby Atmos audio). The *vast* majority of people with 4K TVs still have HDMI 2.0, which is limited to 4K at **60 fps** (and can't output uncompressed Dolby Atmos audio).

- However, there's very little reason to upgrade your TV to HDMI 2.1, because Aaron Greenburg said that 4K @ **60fps** will be the [""standard output""](https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x-features-60-fps-standard-output-confirms-xboxs-aaron-greenberg#:~:text=Today%2C%20Xbox's%20Aaron%20Greenberg%20said,appear%20to%20be%20the%20case.) on the Series X.

**The Xbox One X and current HDMI 2.0 TVs can *already* do that.**

- The biggest reason I wanted to upgrade to the Series X immediately was to play next gen games with ray tracing. However, Halo Infinite wasn't going to launch with ray tracing (hopefully it will after the indefinite delay?), and neither will Valhalla or Cyberpunk. Ray tracing on big titles doesn't seem to be coming until next year, at the earliest.

So, even if you have the latest 4K TV with HDMI 2.1, you'll still just be playing ""next gen"" games at 4K 60fps, with no ray tracing, which **the Xbox One X is already capable of doing right now**.

New games will release on the current generation for the foreseeable future, and Smart Delivery makes upgrading *immediately* even less necessary.

So, the only remaining advantages of upgrading from the One X to the Series X *right now* are:

- Faster loading times
- More *stable* 60fps framerate 
- Quick resume
- Faster UI?

If you have an original Xbox One or Xbox One S, the Series X is a huge upgrade immediately.

However, if you have a Xbox One X, you might want to wait until the big titles are enhanced with ray tracing next year, the price drops, and you don't have to fight the crowds.

EDIT: Others have brought up that your One X will inevitably lose value if you wait to sell it or trade it in, so that's another factor to consider, as well. However, prices on next gen consoles will likely drop next year, especially Black Friday sales, so it might be a wash.",t2_b6lw9

Anyone else really annoyed?.,"I'm no mega fan of xbox, I came into the ecosystem fairly late a year ago with an old xbox one, later i purchased a one x and  subscribed to gamepass which has brought so much value for my money.

Now to the annoying part, why i can't even go on youtube without spotting 5 videos titled ""will Microsoft make bethesda games exclusive"" yes they have made beloved franchises but business is business and they were bought by Microsoft I dont understand the hate towards them possibly going down an exclusivity route.
 It just seems to me Microsoft got the upper hand and people aren't entirely happy about it. None the Iess i wanted to make this post to find like minded people so we can maybe bring awareness to that toxic behavior within the gaming community.

Anyone have trouble enjoying Single Player games over Multieplayer ones?,"Well I am sure but I just wanted to discuss how for the past two years (Ish) I cant seem to sit and play single player games for more than like an hour at a time.

"Microsoft played a great move by buying ZeniMax Media but they could change the landscape forever by doing one simple thing. I’m surprised they’ve not talked about it. Timing is crucial. Do it ASAP, Microsoft.","Why has Phil Spencer / Todd Howard / Pete better yet Microsoft or ZeniMax not even hinted at this yet? 

MODDING! CREATION CLUB! utilise it! I’m over the moon about this deal it’s nothing but good news, but I feel Microsoft are just not realising something here as if I was them I’d get to work on announcing it ASAP.  

Microsoft now essentially own the rights to these excellent franchises, timeless classics that people still play to this day (Elder Scrolls Skyrim / Fallout 4) now these were the first titles to receive mod support on console.  Which is great it’s a excellent baby step.  But then came along Creation Club okay initially a step backwards but let’s not underestimate its usage here, it provides more income towards the studios and at the same time gives its users more content with the excellent benefit of being graded content that lets you expand your game whilst also STILL enabling ACHIEVEMENTS.  

So a lot of people and I know a lot of people do this, they get one of these games, buy creation club content, love it for adding to the game, and once they get 1000g, they get the real reward which is actual mods, that completely change the game to something new. BUT that’s after they’ve done everything so by then they usually drop it for PC which is just unfetted access to brilliant content, nice.  

However it’s been years since these were created and the flak has settled down, and a lot of people do not want to play on PC and not get achievements on Xbox they don’t care about steam achievements, they care about their progression on Xbox, we’re their main characters are.  Tons of people.  Some people also just have preferences.  

There is DLC that has come or is coming to PC which is just insane! sheer insanity and the work gone into these things are beyond crazy.  Why is Microsoft not helping the devs ship these ideas to console? unifying it all for PC / Xbox ? do it now! it’s insane.  Here are some examples. 

Fallout 4: 

Fallout: Miami 
- Trailer:  https://youtu.be/aPtAjvtJhf8

Apologise for the lack of fallout 4 examples I personally don’t mod it much because I prefer to play it on Xbox and I currently don’t have 1000g on it.  


Elder Scrolls Skyrim: 
- Familar Faces (amazing mod) it lets you do new game plus but your old characters are characters in your new play through. 

- Beyond Skyrim: (creating all of Tamriel within Skyrim) 
Example: https://youtu.be/oCRWN2Emgbw 

- Skyblivion: 
https://youtu.be/68uUeZGppXw

- Ordinator (essentially a adds massive amounts of skill tree perks (I think it’s over 500 new skills). 

I have played a lot of these on PC tons of them I’ve even missed out hundreds more I’m just listing some examples.  But now Microsoft own both ends of the pipeline, come on and do something already.  I love modding on my PC but I also get bored when I know my progress isn’t really going forward on the system I game mainly on which is Xbox and the choice would be lovely to have, I’d even pay for these mods and wished their was creation club versions to support both Microsoft and the creators/modders.  The option should exist and now there is no excuse, none and it benefits everyone involved.  Yes these are old games, but game pass is the perfect platform to grow this still.  Let’s be honest TES6 is years away, this is the perfect time to get this going.  (I play Skyrim special edition to this day on Xbox STILL) so do my friends.  Not everyone wants to HAVE to use a PC and a load order download to do this.  People also want their progress and achievements earn able with mods on, so certify these mods, charge me I don’t care just do it.  And those opposed to creation club, well you can’t complain since these would be free in the mods list anyway or you have PC.  There is nothing wrong with choice.  

Creation Club content is spares, short and usually expensive, there is no trying to pretend it’s not, but it gives us the ability to get achievements and it works with the game giving it an authentic certified feel.  So why has the content just forzen to a halt? it’s discounted a lot which is nice, but if Microsoft allowed or begun the process of getting the back log of thousands of mods onto it, surely this would lower the cost over time since there would be enough content there to of course offset such things, and why is the space for these mods so short?.  

It’s awful that this hasn’t been requested or talked about much and the potential to have an strong instant effect that is positive for both PC users and Xbox users right now is there.  Yet I feel Microsoft will just sit on it and do nothing.  

You know what else this would do? show up Sony and how their policies are kinda of bad in this day and age, it would also give a lot of people reasons to stick with Xbox/PC and game pass, it’s on equal footing than even letting PlayStation have access to TES6.  PlayStation users could have TES6 but if modding / creation club and all these amazing ideas were made “official” that would mean a lot more to many many people and having TES6 on PlayStation wouldn’t mean a thing in contrast because the real experience is on Xbox/ PC (it’s already on PC).  

So what I’m trying to say is WE as a community need to get the ball rolling, spread the word and more done, we need a dialogue with Microsoft to let them know how important this is.  Because I’m pretty sick of having to use PC for this, I want it official I want to have choice and I don’t care how.  I want my Bethesda games to last me a lot longer and surprise me everyday whilst I can get achievements and progress.  We need to hear what Microsoft thinks because no real roadblock is in the way now.  It should be a thing.   I just don’t see much mentioned since the deal has gone down.  I’d expect it to be high priority.   

Anyway, I’m just pretty sick of hoping.  I want information and i imagine so many others do too.

Edit:  il also add shutting these creators down and resetting everything to ZERO would be the dumbest move that could possibly be played.",t2_42lnl6wp

I'm not really sweating it, but I'm curious how long it'll take me to get one. The last console launch I was able to get my PS4, but not my Xbox. I got into PC gaming at the end of 2014, so by the time I was interested in getting a One, Destiny and Gamerscore grind wants,  January of 2015, I was able to just buy one at wal mart.

My first non-Nintendo purchase in a decade,"Don't get me wrong, I love Nintendo dearly for Zelda, but that's really been the only series I've played in the last ten or more years. Growing up I could only have one console, and I chose Zelda. I realized recently that I could actually have more than one console and not go broke (or I could go broke but at this point in the year I don't give a shit).

I wish I could describe the feeling of getting something on which I could play all sorts of ""mature"" games like COD, Forza, Witcher, Assassin's Creed. I know you can play some of these on Switch but it's just not the same. I understand Nintendo has their own goals that don't line up necessarily with Microsoft and Sony regarding online play and cutting edge graphics, but it's a huge change coming from a lifetime of Nintendo to Xbox. I'm happy I didn't buy one of these earlier in my youth because I wouldn't have got a damn thing done. Anyone else come to xbox after a long time with Nintendo?",t2_5yomj

Will Microsoft have limited edition consoles at launch or soon after?,"My main question is when is comes to limited edition consoles like the cyberpunk 2077 Xbox one X or even the battlefield 1 one s that I currently have, is the series X expected to have limited edition designs like this at launch? 

I am very excited for the Xbox series X and would like to pre order one, the only problem is that I would also love to get my hands on any sort of limited edition console. 

Seeing as I do not have much money and would only be able to by one console, will there be limited editions at launch? Or will I have to wait a couple months to buy one? 

I know there may not be much conclusive information out there right now, but I'm just wondering what Microsoft has done in the past in regards to that. 

I have never bought any consoles at launch so I'm not really sure myself, I only bought the one s after it had been out for quite a while.

Should I pre order or wait?

Are Xbox Pivoting Away From Achievements/Gamerscore?,"Over the last few software updates, both on the console (removing achievements tab), and on the android/iOS apps (no reference to achievements and gamerscore at all) it seems Microsoft is pivoting away from them. 

I’ve noticed even the splash screens on Windows games and iOS games don’t show your gamerscore either when you sign in like they used to.

If Microsoft discontinued achievements and gamerscore I would be extremely disappointed and would definitely move across to Sony as they are very nostalgic and a source of pride and after amassing over 500,000 gamerscore over 12 years on Xbox if Microsoft just got rid of them I feel they would lose a huge amount of goodwill from the achievement hunting community as it is a major element of what ties us to the ecosystem.

I know there are many people that have no interest but sites like TrueAchievements have huge engagement and I think Xbox are making a mistake by moving away from them.",t2_4s6iwx90

"I said ""fuck it"" and pulled the trigger on a one X today.","I have mainly gamed on a Switch and 3DS for the last few years. I had a ps4 but I honestly hate Sony's business ethics and I felt no connection to the first party games besides God of War. I wanted a newer system come next month. Me and my wife were able to secure a ps5 for my son and I was left in the dust. I couldn't get a hold of an Xbox series S or X, and no ps5.  I felt stupid for calling stores asking if they had any pre-orders left and when I was laughed at during a call it really sucked. 

I hate having a 1080p console on a 4k tv. It looks awful and unnatural. I wanted a new system that could hit true 4K. Sony's fake checkerboard crap wasn't going to cut it. I got a refurbished xbox one X with a one year warranty for $280. I figured that since Xbox was behind on 1st party support right now this could give me the time to play games like Far Cry 5 before jumping to the new gen. At least two years.

Xbox Series X seems to be outselling Playstation 5 in Brazil,"
The pre orders for XSX and XSS only started yesterday (Sep-29) in Brazil. PS5 pre orders, on the other hand, started at the same world-wide date (Sep-17) here.

After 12 days PS5s are not sold out yet in any of the top 3 national retailers. And several retailers are now giving 5-10% discounts. [ps5_link](https://www.americanas.com.br/produto/1838061077/console-playstation-5-ps5), [ps5_link2](https://m.pontofrio.com.br/console-playstation-5-controle-sem-fio-dualsense-55010438.html)

Amazon (which is new in the country) still have XSXs available, and lists XSX and XSS as the 2 best selling items in its ""Games and Consoles"" category, with the PS5 in 4th position.

Xbox Game Pass needs more new sport games to become the complete package,"Game Pass is starting to become an absolute force for gaming. It is adding games that I never thought would be added to a service like this, at least at this point in time. Easily the best deal in gaming. However, there are a lot of gamers that primarily play sports games (NBA 2k, madden, Fifa, NHL, etc) and this really is a portion of the market that game pass hasn't hit yet.  Adding EA access is a great start. A lot of the older games will now be available, but how about those that want to play newer sports games?


At first I thought this was unlikely purely due to the fact that so many people buy these games already, what incentive is there to add them. However, most of these games are now so micro transaction heavy (which I hate) that I could see them putting the game on gamepass to get more traffic through the game and therefore more microtransactions.


Overall, one of the few genre's that is really underrepresented on game pass are sports titles, and bringing the new 2k, madden, Fifa, etc to the service would cement it as a must have in just about every gamer's household. Hopefully these games aren't neglected from the plans for the future of game pass.",t2_7ti6w

Atmos vs. Standard DD 5.1,"I recently got an audio setup that supports Dolby Atmos, so I was excited to test it out (I know only a select list of games have Atmos support).

What I’ve noticed is when I set the audio output to Atmos in the system settings, for SOME games that don’t support Atmos, this actually results in no longer getting 5.1 surround at all (meaning no sounds from rear channels).  I have to manually go back and switch the settings to regular DD 5.1 for some games to get 5.1 surround.

I was under the impression that even if a game doesn’t support Atmos, as long as it supports regular DD 5.1, it should flow through without having to change the settings, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.

Anyone else have this experience?

My example and how I tested...

Settings to Dolby Atmos then:
Booted up Forza Horizon 4 (which supports Atmos)&gt; 5.1 surround no problem.
Booted up Wolfenstein 2 (doesn’t support Atmos) &gt; I DON’T get surround at all.

Switch settings to Dolby 5.1 then:
Booted up Wolfenstein 2 &gt; 5.1 surround is back.

Switching the settings isn’t the end of the world, but I’m just curious if anyone else is experiencing this?",t2_6f7jpnls

Xbox system update crashes at 21%,"Hello
I've got a huge problem. My Xbox One X requires a 567MB system update right at the power up sequence. The thing is, it always crashes at 21%. I've tried everything, even tried with my cellphone as a network hotspot and that didn't worked.

I have 150Gb+ of free space on the hard drive so it can't be a weight issue.

I tried contacting Xbox support, it's ridiculous they don't even let me message them I'm always redirected to a virtual agent (reaaaaally helpful Microsoft....) wich only directs me to troubleshooting..

I'm pretty desperate, it's been 3 days so I don't think it's their servers either.

I don't have an external HD or a USB key, if I had one of those I'd try to do it offline.

I always get the same 3 error codes :
0x80070570 0x00000000 0x90000005

Since Microsoft can't be contacted anymore, I really hope someone got a solution..

Thank you",t2_4ot9biwx

My 4-month-old Elite 2 controller's right bumper isn't working unless I press down firmly right in the middle. Microsoft only offers a 90-day warranty. :/,"I bought an Elite 2 controller from Costco back in late May, so just over 4 months ago. 

Last week I noticed the right bumper wasn't registering fully, and it's continued to get worse. Sometimes it's totally fine, but other times I have to press down firmly right in the middle and outward areas don't register at all. This has been hugely frustrating in Warzone, as trying to throw C4 etc. has sometimes not worked responsively.

Microsoft only offers a 90-day warranty of course (sooo ridiculous that a $180 controller is only covered that amount of time!) but I'm hoping Costco will honor it. Thing is, I don't even know if they still stock them (it was an online exclusive at the time).

I was looking at homemade DIY repairs and someone said rubbing alcohol can help sticky buttons (in case it's actually sticky and not broken), but another person said it can damage the internal battery... does anyone know if I'd be OK pouring a tiny bit of rubbing alcohol along the corners? Any other suggestions?

The Difference between Smart Delivery and Cross-buy (from a developer),"As more games start to offer cross-buy you will start to see details on what makes smart delivery a rich feature and not just a term for cross-buy

Here is an example from the game [Maneater](https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads%2Fmaneater-evolves-with-next-gen-enhancements.2336583%2F): 

 

* **This is not a different application/game on XBox Series S &amp; X** and saves and trophies/achievements will carry forward.
   * This may require subscriptions to additional services such as XBox Gold (such as for cloud save transfers)
* **This IS a separate application/game on PlayStation 5** and trophies, stats and saves will not transfer

Another example from [Dirt 5 Developer](https://twitter.com/dirtgame/status/1309060318614687750?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1309060318614687750%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_2&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fs9e.github.io%2Fiframe%2F2%2Ftwitter.min.html1309060318614687750):

Also if this get some answers I will post a video or some kind of link to a audio clip of the beeping on 20+ db so it can be heard, also sometimes the beeping sounds like a siren but after like 1-3 hours the beeping is gone. After some small research I've read it's maybe the hard drive or caused due to instant on, also seems like hearing beeps causes the console to not be able to turn on, but I've never had a problem since this beeping started, and I've already had this thing fixed once because it wouldn't display anything, but that was before the beeping.",t2_7wgz88g3

"""X took too long to start""","Hey guys, I've been having a problem on One S for the past couple months now. I've looked in the tech support post and saw that some people have the same issues BUT all of the fixes that have worked for them have done nothing for me so I was hoping if anyone has any other suggestions.. I'm willing to try almost anything at this point.

So here's the issue: NBA 2K20 was working perfectly fine for a few months but up until around May/June iirc the game was beginning to freeze at certain spots. Eventually, this led to the infamous ""X took too long to start"" error. I had believed this to be exclusively a fault with the game itself but soon it started to affect the rest of the console. 
It began with Monster Hunter: World but restarting my console would make MH:W work again. It then spread to FIFA 20 as well and when this happened that's when it really got out of control. Essentially all my games eventually couldn't start except for like Skate 3 which I found strange 😂 

Also on top of most of my games breaking, my Xbox also runs extremely slowly to the point that the scrolling sound on the dashboard sounds like a Transformer. 

So my question, other than if anyone has any solutions, would be is it possible for the actual NBA 2K20 disc to be causing these issues? I tested this on my brother's Xbox as well, also a One S, and it caused the same issues so that's why I now suspect the game itself. 

So some more information that might be relevant to troubleshooting and maybe help someone going through the same:
https://windowsreport.com/took-too-long-to-start-xbox-one-error/

As of today I've officially exhausted every solution on the list and then some. I've re-installed the game online, offline, with the latest update, without the latest update, I've reset to factory settings many times (both keeping games and apps and deleting everything), cleared reserved space, persistent storage, changed my location,, turned instant-on off etc. I think you get the point lol

Umm so it seems okay when I uninstall 2K so I feel confident that it was the game. I'm not convinced it's the disc because when 2K was on Game Pass and I installed it without the disc it still did the same. Is it possible for a game to (effectively) brick a console like this because I was under the assumption that corrupted saved data and files causes this error so I'm really confused.

ANY help would be greatly appreciated!",t2_3m62crs5

Does an Xbox One Series X or S make more sense in my use case?,"I currently have an Xbox One X that I don't play as much anymore. The reason is that I built a gaming pc last year that's not too shabby. (Ryzen 2600X and RTX 2070 with 16GB of ram on an SSD). My main use of the Xbox is for games not available on PC, like Kingdom Hearts III, and for games I already bought before I built my PC and did not want to buy again.

I mostly game on a 1080p 144hz monitor, though 80% the games I play are not high fps, and intensive enough to run between 70-120fps. Occasionally I game on my Samsung 4K TV due to the niceness of easier couch gaming without the Steam casting. However due to my specs, I have to reduce most settings to medium and some to low to maintain a 60fps average (without true sync like my monitor's). That being said, the TV is 60hz (Samsung NU8000 50"" I got a couple years back). I have no intention of buying a new TV. For the record I have a subscription to Game Pass Ultimate.

Currently Gamestop offers $200 when trading in an Xbox One X, meaning the Series S would cost about $100 and the X about $300. For the 1080p 144hz and 4K 60hz on average, which of the two would make most sense? Ideally I'd like to save as much as possible. I don't really care about super high framerate on my monitor since I plan to upgrade my GPU as needed. But I do want a stable 60fps on my 60hz 4K tv without much of a compromise/dip.

Honest question: Will Microsoft buy or is about to buy Thq Nordico / Embracer Group? READ DESCRIPTION !!,"I wonder if it is Thq Nordic for different points:

&amp;#x200B;

* They have published many games on Gamepass and Live.
* In the Embracer group report they make it very clear that their business model will be to work with subscriptions and cloudgaming services.
* They are buying studios, IPs and publishers as if they are working on something big in the short term.
* Phil Spencer recently went to visit the Nordic lands, it is not known if it was for Cyberpunck or for something else.
* And on twitter it is one of the favorites, just search for #Thq and you will see that many think this.

  
Edit: There is also another point, but this may make little sense because I am ignorant about the matter. In July or August they reported on the Embracer group page that they had $ 1.5B (Country currency) in issuance of shares that would help them work in the short and long term in business and purchase more studios, and ... I can't stop to think that's weird ...

Does Microsoft still have a chance against Sony?,"Units Sold / Marketshare:

* WW1 (Xbox vs PS2): 24m vs 155m = 179m total (13% vs. 87%)

* WW3 (X1 vs. PS4): 50m vs 112m = 162m (31% vs. 69%)

I'm really hoping Microsoft wins WW4 between the value they offer, the power of their technology, and their overall consumer-friendly practices.  I honestly think it would be #1 if it weren't for the very turbulent X1 launch, which it largely corrected but it was too late, and exclusive titles that Sony has signed.

I finally played Gears 5 while I was home sick.,"I finished Gears 5's campaign today and I justed needed to say that whether or not I go the Xbox Series X or PS5 route (still undecided) I had a blast.  

I've been with the franchise since the start. I even grew up in the city where it was developed (I had a signed copy of Gears of War 3 back home as well, from a midnight release where some developers were doing a signing at a local Gamestop).  Gears of War was the co-op shooter my friends and I played in between Halo releases. We would go through the campaign at scheduled times so no one got left behind and when we beat the story we would play endless rounds of horde and try and beat wave 50 on each map, some nights we were up until 3 am (for reference I was 17 in highschool when 3 came out).  

When Gears of War 4 came out I was excited to get back on and clear it with my friends, but unfortunately they had all grown tired of the series. So me and my younger beat it together and I stuck around for a bit of multiplayer and horde for a bit, no where near as much as 2 or 3.  It was the ultimate experience I had when I was a kid but I appreciated my brother tagging along even if he had no investment to the story or anything. 

So by the time Gears 5 came out I was hesitant to play it, since my brother now lives in a different time zone and doesn't play online as much anymore either.  I had Game pass so I downloaded it. Got in a match of horde just see how it looked and felt. Yup felt like Gears alright.  Then I played the story and stopped about halfway through the second act.  I just wasn't feeling it.  And I pretty much put it out of my mind all together. 

Then this weekend I got a mild cold and couldn't work the last few days.  I figured I could use some action and melodrama so I decided to boot up Gears 5 and sink my teeth in.

I beat it in less then a couple days but what a ride. The story was pretty good honestly, I didn't really appreciate swapping protagonists after only one game in the new trilogy but I ended up preferring Kait over JD overall, she's just something different for the series and her motivation was interesting enough to get me hooked. 

Now while I liked the story, I loved the moments of sheer spectacle.  There were times when I would drop my jaw when I certain scene would happen.  I haven't felt so tiny in a videogame since Halo 2 verses the Scarab.  And I wasn't just tiny, I was the scrappy Outsider on a mission. I was pretty immersed I'd say.  The visuals and sound design, just outstanding. 

But the gameplay, the most I've ever clicked in a Gears of War game.  Using Jack's abilities allowed me to change it up and figure out new tactics.  There were so many hairpin moments where one shot and one second decided whether or not I was going to be a splatter on the screen, and when I pulled it off, just fantastic.  Or when I was using the GL Lancer and managed to get 4-5 drones in one shot during an intense fight. So satisfying.  And that's the other thing every firefight was tense and after each one it only ramped up and up.  Oh and the boss fight in act 2, I died countless times but eventually when I overcame it I got that sigh of relief that I honestly haven't had with a game for a while.  This game made me feel like a kid again going, ""what the fuck?!"" like I did when I was in highschool with my friends. 

I didn't care too much for the open world. I liked the side objectives alright, nothing memorable, the component parts kept me checking every nook and cranny, and the skiff when it got up to speed was really fun to drive, but it felt too empty and padding to validate it being there.  You could've kept the linear level design and maybe had an optional side mission you could either ignore or do along the route and it'll bring you back to where you were, but I guess they were just following trends or something.  

I gotta say I didn't expect to write a full review like this before 10pm, but I was just surprised how much I actually enjoyed this game.  I look back on the series fondly but when I'm away from it I usually just think of it as ""The big dudes shoot at the ugly dude behind a well placed wall"" and kinda just write it off.  But when I'm actually playing it, I get it.  It is definitely just like I described but it's got more to it then I remembered and I'm glad I got this cold so I could play it.  Whether or not I stick with Xbox or not this was a good game to finish this generation on.

Edit: I wrote this on mobile and now my thumbs are sore...",t2_iuvj7

Xbox Series X on Launch Day,Does anyone know what the launch title(s) will be once the Xbox series X release?,t2_5go0ehns
Why 4K-60FPS must be the new standard?,"I would make this as clear as possible, when you tell your developers their game must support 4K 60 FPS, you actually telling them to lower the graphics specs of the game. (As long as its not an indie game)

To run a game on 4k 60FPS you need a really strong Computer, and I know the Xbox series X is pretty strong but still not enough.

People need to understand that a game can look a lot better on 1080P 60FPS than 4k 60 FPS and even 4k 30 fps sometimes , because there are other aspects of graphics other than resolution...

This statement of almost everything needs to support ""4K 60 FPS"" will make games look about the same as now as we play them on our current generation consoles with the difference of them running 4K on the new consoles. That's wrong.",t2_jkkuzsz

I've tried removing and re-seating the HDMI to have it auto detect again (although still have to manually set up the remote) 

Deleting and manually setting up the remote 

Full reset of the TV and so far nothing has helped :(

Who do you watch/follow for discussions on gaming?,"I was wondering who/what the sources are people follow for discussing gaming news. 

I'm not talking about IGN or Gamespot or other, big websites that break news and such; I'm talking more about individuals on social media that give their quick takes but still produce quality content at the same time. Where it's not the same information you could find elsewhere. 

One example would be someone like Brad Sams who is on YouTube and just drops the news and gives his thoughts on it. He is specific to Microsoft products of all kinds but I still enjoy him for his Xbox takes. Another is ReviewTechUSA who has a few videos throughout the day and then has a livestream at night where he just fields questions via chats. 

Surely there are more people like this and these are just two that I've found after getting an interest back in gaming after nearly a decade away from it.

Is there anyone else that has a similar setup for their channels and discusses things in a similar way? I guess Lew Later is another presentation style to use as an example.",t2_3b3ly

Also note, that your remaining time will be rounded up, so anything over 50 days will be treated like 3 months and thus gives you 1 month of ultimate!

"I heard a rumor that the Devs are a little more active in paying attention to the customers wants more than the PS4 devs. Is this true, and could you possibly link me to examples?","Life has pulled me from Xbox, but if this is true, I would much rather migrate my library for an even slightly improved user experience. 

(More about me and my experience. TL;DR's by the paragraph) 

**TL;DR** - Don't choose a system based off what other people have. If they actually play the same games as you, they probably don't have the time to. 

I think it's been about five years since I switched. At the time I had a bunch of co-workers and a few friends on the  PlayStation side when I decided to go with the crowed. Since then, I've spent maybe 5% of my play time playing with other PlayStation users. 


**TL;DR** -  My games aren't proprietary and people sound better muted


The overall experience has been rather bland to be honest. The community is pretty toxic in the games I play based on the majority of interactions. (If you didn't know already, I'm absolute garbage and my mother is a very social woman.) I mainly play Apex, RocketLeague, and lately I've really enjoyed Ancestors The Humankind Odyssey. Other than that the games I play really aren't exclusive to the platform. 


**TL;DR** - Entertainment apps are slow and the overall UI feels so cumbersome

The UI is as impractical today as it was the day I got the console. You can group games into folders, but you can't take certain apps out of the entertainment folder. It takes about - okay I timed it. It took exactly 54.26 seconds and 4 to 5 clicks from the home screen just to  open Netflix. NETFLIX dude. YouTube is double the clicks because it's positioned further away in the folder of ""Can't Take It Out"". This might sound ridiculous, but I've at so many cold dinners just trying to set up a movie I *want* to watch. Call me crazy, but I don't remember Xbox's home screen being so insanely difficult. 


**TL;DR** - Partying up is easily 10x harder than I remember Xbox being. 

""Starting a party? Sure! Lemme just create the room..........okay I..... I think that's it............oh wait! I gotta invite the person hah, my fault!"" - PS4

My console doesn't speak in the ""traditional sense"", but you get the idea. 


**TL;DR** - If you think you have memory, think again. 

It is entirely possible to have a significant amount of storage left that would more than cover the size of a games update, BUT apparently you have to be able to load up TWICE the amount of complete storage the game requires or something like that simply because, 
""That's how it is."" - SONY rep
This meant that in order to update Red Dead Redemption, or Call of Duty MW; I needed to have about 150-200gb free at all times. Luckily I got the terabyte console to house these games on! 
""Just buy the disc!"" That is a wonderful idea, except RDR2 *is* a disc.  
I feel cheated out of multiple titles. I didn't mention Starwars Battlefront because I got it in the free game of the month offer. 


**TL;DR** - The controller sucks ass. 


**TL;DR** - Gameplay recoding is far superior on Xbox 

I've since gotten used to this, but damn I miss remembering how much better clipping gameplay was on Xbox... Have they made improvements? Tell me about the rabbits...



Okay, I think I've said enough. There's some more I look for that I'm not getting into, but my update finally downloa- alright it still has to install.

Can't play Destiny 2 on same network with other Xbox,"Been tearing my hair out over this issue reading countless forum and reddit posts, trying all suggestions without success and I'm about at my limit.

Hardware:

Modem: Arris SB8200

Router: Netgear Nighthawk AC1750 (R6700v3)

Xbox One X (x2)


The problem:

My room mate and I can play together just the two of us in a fireteam for hours without issue, but if we bring a friend into the fireteam and attempt to do an activity, one of us will get booted, every time.

Some other interesting details present are:

- In the Xbox friends list, I appear offline to him even though I'm not set to Appear Offline.

- Given the above, if he sends me an invite to anything, I won't get it, but, I can send him invites, and he does get it.


What I've tried:

- Automatic IPs, UPnP enabled = can't play at all without being disconnected almost immediately with a wide assortment of Bungie error codes (beaver, eel, etc)

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled = same result

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled, + putting one Xbox in DMZ = same result

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled + IPv6 enabled = we can play without issue


At this stage, I should mention, within the Xbox Advanced Network settings, we both have Open NATs, differently assigned port numbers, and show IPv4 &amp; IPv6 in use.


Now, when we attempt playing with others in the fireteam, my NAT remains Open while the other Xbox gets a Moderate NAT (and as mentioned, one of us will get booted after starting an activity).


To try and solve this, I tried:

- Disabling UPnP, reset router, Re-enabling UPnP, reset router again, then reset modem, and both Xbox's = same issue

- Disabling UPnP, enable port forwarding for ports 88, 500, 3074, 3544, and 4500 on one system, and 89, 501, 3075, 3544, and 4501 on the other, reset everything like above = same result


This should NOT be necessary at all to get two systems working.  Almost every help topic I come across about this mentions how Bungie is a clueless pos when it comes to networking so, I'm confident it IS on their end (and maybe some of XBL too given what I mentioned about appearing offline and invites not working), but, clearly some people can make it work with all these fixes, and others make it work with no configuration at all.


Things I've not tried yet:

- Getting a 2nd IP from Comcast (from what I understand this should definitively fix the issue)

- Getting a different router


I'm not sure a 2nd IP is available to me, that's something I need to call about, but if it's not available then...

As for another router, what I'd love to know is, for those with multiple Xbox's who play Destiny 2 together without any extra configuration, what is the router that you're using?  I want it.

Any help with this is appreciated!",t2_5fbf4cz

The load times for legacy games off a USB SSD are nearly on par with loading off the internal NVMe SSD.  It's *under a second* difference when loading Assassin's Creed Origins.   This shows that backwards compatible games don't need to be taking up valuable internal space to be played with the really quick loads.

&amp;#x200B;

Why isn't there much difference between the internal SSD and an external SSD?  It's probably because the processing of data off the drive is the real bottleneck.

&amp;#x200B;

This is explored in the [Ars Technica preview](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/xbox-series-x-hands-on-the-big-back-compat-dive-begins/) where they loaded off a USB mechanical drive with the Series X and also achieved very significant gains.

A story behind the new Flight Sim Japan Update trailer,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalJaTmv-TY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalJaTmv-TY)

A trailer for Flight Sim Japan Update was re-uploaded a few hours ago to celebrate its launch and to reflect some feedback regarding a political controversy.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima\_Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima_Island)

In the original video released during TGS, there was a scene with Hashima Island, a.k.a ""*Warship* Island"", a small island that were originally developed as a coal mine. During WWII, the island became a sort of 'labor camp', as Korean and Chinese civilians and prisoners were sent to the island to work at the mine under very harsh condition. 

After the initial trailer was uploaded, people immediately complained about the place being introduced as a 'beautiful scenery'. As exotic and beautiful as it may appear from the sky above, it represents a painful war memory for the survivors from the labor camp that are still alive to this day.

Microsoft told South Korean media 5 days ago that they were sorry and the trailer would be updated to remove the scene. [https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=110559](https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=110559) (a link for a Korean news article)

&amp;#x200B;

And a few hours ago, the old trailer was removed as the new one got uploaded.

Xbox One X shutting itself down.,"Help! My Xbox One X keeps shutting down on its own, for about the last week it has been shutting off while either searching for a match in COD or Apex, OR it shuts down right when a match ends of Rainbow Six Siege or Halo MCC.  

This does NOT appear to be an overheating issue as the console is barely warm, definitely not hot. It’s in an open area with good air flow, I’ve tried plugging in back in and removing the power cable, I did a factory reset, reinstalled games, switched from wires to wireless network, and took it apart to clean it. Nothing seems to do the trick.  My warranty is expired and it would cost $250 to replace so I’m not going to do that with the new consoles coming out. 

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!",t2_t43c8

Xbox password issue and Epic games linking,"I sure hope someone can help a dad out here. My young son normally plays Rocket League and Fortnite on the Switch.

This one slipped through. 

Anyway, I can log into epic games with his Switch account and see both Nintendo and Xbox linked. However, I can no longer log him into the Xbox. I have tried password recovery with Microsoft but I don’t have enough info for them. From what I understand, if I unlink his Xbox account from Epic, I am unable to link a new Xbox account to it.

Xbox One Recordings: It is a case of luck,"Hi Guys,

I believe that there are dozens of posts about this but all of them suggests the same full power reset which doesn't always solve the problem.

The biggest disappointment with my current Xbox One X even with S is when you have that awesome kill, hit record, go check it later and all you have is a 6s video. The same applies to external storage which enables 1h recording.  
To try to avoid that, I always hit record like 2-4 times to make sure it will save.  


I believe I have tried everything:

* Full power reset. I always turn off/full power off the console, then turn off the wall socket - Australia power socket
* USB stick 3.0, good one
* External  Toshiba 128GB USB 3.0 mSATA  \~380MB/s
* External Silicon Power 1TB NVMe PCIe USB 3.0 storage which used to be my main storage and crazy fast loading. But the console would freak out sometimes which recently I discover it has to be an NGFF SATA so I went back to my WD 3TB USB 3.0 where all my games are stored and played from  \~480MB/s
* I've tried different USB ports from the console
* Even recording to the console which limits you to 2min, you end up with 6s videos.

I don't wanna spend thousands with captures devices, I am not a bloody YouTuber haha  
I don't wanna lose my 4K HDR TV either, the majority of the devices limit the output to 1080p

My recording setting is set to 1080p. I have even tried 720p before and still.

Is there anyone with an up to do date solution for this annoying issue?

Thanks a lot guys",t2_4d6mk7x6

I set my xbox as my home xbox a while ago though...,t2_127qca

Is it possible to share the Gamepass ultimate (PC+xbox) with another person?,"I currently own the xbox gamepass on the PC, but I've pre ordered the new xbox. I heard it was possible to share the gamepass with a friend. Is this indeed possible? If so, how? Thank you in advance!",t2_r4ewb
Swapping out HDD,"Hey everyone, my wife's xbox one x busted and was giving E102 and E105 errors before completely crashing. She is currently using an OG xbox one we had from before the one x upgrades. However, games play like crap on them and she has issues playing stuff we want to together. We have an extra OG that was mine just sitting not doing anything. Can I take that HDD out of there and out it in the one x to see if it works without having it flag as a modded system. I tried asking on Microsoft answers and was just told it wasn't meant to be swapped and would be a violation of the terms of service, which understandable and doesn't matter since the xbox is past warrenty anyway. We were hoping to get a series x pre order, but that didn't work out lol so I want to try and get the one x back to functioning. Thanks for any assistance!",t2_15emfcf0

Xbox Gamepass Ultimate : Get it before price inflates,"Xbox Gamepass Ultimate is the most lucrative deal in the gaming market right now.
However, I feel the gamepass prices are going to go up next year with so many AAA titles being added to it as day 1 release.
I have grandfathered myself with gamepass ultimate membership for the next 2 years buying gamepass codes on discount from Costco (expires May 2022).
Let me know what you guys think about my opinion.",t2_2t1v0ovp

Series X Backwards Compatible Question.,"After watching the Digital Foundry video on running Xbox One/360 games on the Series X's SSD i have a question. The games seemed to be running pretty much at 60 fps with really quick load times, but if we run backwards compatible games on the Series X from an external HDD, i realise the load times will not be as fast, but will we still get the 60 fps, or does it need to be run on the Series X's SSD to get 60 fps. TIA",t2_ronpojj
