"Media Posting is now ON (pics, gifs, videos) for while.","Hey r/PS5,

Things are a bit stale here so we're going to turn on media posting. That way you can upload images, gifs and whatnot. Please note, we still have rules and just because a post is in pic/gif form doesn't mean it can bypass the rules. Here a recap on a few of the rules that are most likely to be violated.

**Prohibited Content**

* Memes &amp; Shitposts
* Twitter reactions/A reaction from someone on the internet
* Commonly posted concepts
* Incites console wars/flamebait/pcmr
* Misinformation/Misleading posts
* Duplicate of a topic/issue/news that has already been posted

**Title Guidelines**

* Clickbait, editorialized, sensationalized, misleading titles, or attempting to draw attention to the post.
* Vague, generalised, unclear titles. Titles must describe the content of the post.
* Post about a specific game must include the name of the game in the title.

If all goes well, we might continue this but for now, let's give it a test run. We want to see how this impacts the sub before we decide to move forward with how media posting is handled here.

If you have any thoughts, ideas etc about how we can do media posts here or your thoughts on how it's going. Let us know in the comments!",t2_5r8xp

Sony should capitalize on gyro-aiming this generation.,"Gyro aiming is a way of minimizing the precision gap between controllers versus mouse&amp;keyboard. The use of gyro aiming doesn't replace the the right analog stick, but instead is used merely for fine-tuning. For those unfamiliar, here are a few videos illustrating in different ways its surprising potential for shooter games:

————

[\[Halo with gyro aiming\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqaz6SxnwnI&amp;t=1s)

[\[Linus Tech Tips\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qlZmXnE1mw)

[\[Motion Controls and the Rejection of Progress\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=binPB4YbWmM&amp;ab_channel=Nerrel)

————

 Unfortunately, gyro aiming is often misunderstood. Here are common arguments I see against it, and why they aren't compelling:

**I wouldn't use it.** That's fine. But others would like to, and making it optional can leave everyone happy.

**It shouldn't be mandatory.** To my knowledge, no shooter has ever made gyro aiming mandatory.

**It would be expensive.** Gyro sensors are relatively inexpensive and wouldn't require any novel technology.

**It hinders accessibility.** More options increases accessibility.

**It's a gimmick.** Gyro aiming requires minimal movement and provides enhanced precision, unlike certain previous implementations of motion controls that have rightly been regarded as gimmicky.

**Not enough people care about it.** That's quickly changing as more and more people come to realize its potential.

————

On the other hand, there are good arguments in favor of gyro aiming. Most importantly, joysticks are intrinsically limited for aiming; gyro aiming enables a finer degree of precision. This

* fine-tunes the controls.
* enhances player agency.
* raises the skill ceiling without necessarily raising the skill floor.
* reduces the need to rely on auto-aim as a crutch.

————

One of the significant but underappreciated differences between the PS5 and XBX is that the PS5's controller enables gyro-aiming while the XBX's controller does not. However, there's been little effort by Sony to capitalize on this advantage. This is nothing new—the PS4 controller has a gyro sensor, but gyro aiming often wasn't even implemented in PS4's first-person shooters. This strikes me as a missed opportunity.

If you agree, I suggest reaching out to Sony via social media. The technology is already there—it's just up to Sony to take advantage of it.",t2_gxwjj

(Unpopular Opinion?) There is absolutely not a lack of content or information coming from Sony,"First let me say that I've enjoyed hanging out on this subreddit during the build up to PS5 and I've seen some really great posts on here, in fact I changed from a long time lurker to poster because of this sub!

I must say however that recently (especially the last week), I've seen several people commenting that there's nothing coming from Sony and they're getting frustrated with the lack of info.

I'm not sure if its because I'm an older gamer (started on snes for reference lol) but this comes across as such impatience to me when I see it. Am I the only one still riding the hype from the showcase that was exactly 2 weeks ago? 

Not to mention the continuous blog posts giving more tid bits. Sure they've not shown the UI but what they have shown me is great looking games that I cant wait to play.

And you know what? I had no idea what the UI on any console I've ever owned would look like before I switched it on and I honestly think it adds to the wonder of using your shiny new console for the very first time. Surpises can be great! 

Apologies for the rant but this has been something that's really grinding my gears lately 😂",t2_akunh

Help me understand Ray Tracing (Spider-Man PS4 remastered) Honest question.," I'm not a pc gamer, so I'm not used to Ray Tracing. 

So from what I heard and know, Ray Tracing allow light to better reflects on surface and to create better reflection. (I can be wrong) 

And as you all know, today this photo of Spider-Man Ps4 remastered came to life. 

[https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv](https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv)

But I feel like there's something wrong.

With how high Peter is and that camera angle, is that normal to see all the street and the pedestrians below him? 

And also is Ray Tracing supposed to be ""like a mirror""? I mean is it supposed to have a 100% reflection of what is on the other side/angle? Is it too exaggerated in the photo or is this really what is Ray Tracing? 

I feel like this is just because it's the beggining of it on consoles so Devs doesn't have a standpoint (except on Pc)

All good things come to those people who wait,"Hello 

I hope you are having a safe journey through 2020. I have seen many posts regarding PlayStation’s silence and wanted to add something to the discussion. So here it goes: 

One thing I know from Sony and PlayStation’s marketing team is they are Marketing Gods amongst men. They know that selling something when it’s sold out is not the best idea. 

There is even a study from University of Alberta and according to them 

“An empty store shelf tempts shoppers to buy the next best thing” 

This means if they start advertising without any stock they might end up selling more of their competitors products. 

In addition, in my opinion PS5’s 

The Load times are better 

The controller is better 

The launch games are better 

The first year games are better 

The third party support is better

Backwards compatible first party games are better 

The UI is better (subjective) 

Also just saying combined with the two IO co processors the CPU is going to be better 

In addition with the cache scrubbers and the higher clock speed on the GPU is going to run better 

All in all just wait all good things will come to those who wait. Only 6 weeks to go.

They finally made it !!! (PS5 DualSense film protection for touchpad and face),"Greetings. Remember when I told you about that I wanted DualSense film protection for the touchpad like the DS4? then I was hopeless and I could not find anything like the the DS4 ones so I decided to get in touch with the makers who make protections for everything, they said they will try!:

https://reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/ivcwhf/ps5_dualsense_touch_pad_exact_sizes_and_dimensions/

Guess what? they responded to me and they were so quick abnd it didn't take them 2 weeks to make it and they did it, not just for the touch pad but also for the entire controller :

Considering you get ultimate edition Watch Dogs 1 with the purchase Ultimate Edition for Watch Dogs Legion (Might be wrong edition) wouldn't it be cool to see an improved upon E3 graphical build of the game? It would surpass what we saw in the E3 presentation and would reignite the game and some may even consider it good after all the bug fixes and graphical upgrade. Chicago would be amazing with detailed streets and NPCs and those focus mode montages would look like a John wick movie no doubt.

Anyone else dislike the subscription model for games?,"Maybe I’m in the minority here but I feel there isn’t enough discussion about this. 

I’m not a big fan of the Netflix-like subscription model for games. 
I was really excited to try out services like PS Now/Game pass, but unfortunately I never touched 90% of the mediocre games they offer in the library. 

Maybe it’s just me or how I treat video games as a form of entertainment. 
It’s not like watching an average popcorn flick on Netflix and have a good time. 
I just can’t invest my time in a mediocre game and have fun. There’s nothing worse than playing a bad game. 

There are some occasional big games added to the library and majority of the users seem to be waiting only for those. And this seriously raises doubts about the value for money aspect with these subscription models. 

I really love the monthly free games offered on PlayStation Plus because for most months, they do give decent games. But this subscription model just doesn’t seem to click with me.",t2_zm0ecm7

Sony should add Google Drive/Dropbox backup for screenshots and videos on PS5,"It would help a lot if we could backup screenshots and videos to Google Drive or Dropbox so it is easier to grab them on our PCs/smartphones. On PS4 we either need to have a USB drive in hand or we send screenshots (one by one) as a message to a dummy account.  The only alteranative for videos is sending them to Youtube and download them later.

I hope Sony allows us to link our Google or Dropbox accounts on PS5 so we can make auto/manual backups. It will probably take a long time but I hope they at least consider it throughout PS5 lifecycle.

First-Party Titles Run At 4K@30 or Dynamic 4K@60?,"So on the Spider-Man Remastered page, it says, [Link](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered/);

&gt;Experience the critically acclaimed hit with updated graphical assets and in stunning dynamic 4K/HDR\*. And experience swinging through New York and combat as an experienced Spider-Man with an optional performance mode that takes advantage of Insomniac’s temporal injection for dynamic 4K/60fps\*.

We have also been told that;

&gt;and the same optional performance mode offered on Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, allowing you to finally play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate.

We also know that Demon's Souls, at least in the trailer, according to DF was rendering internally at 1440p and then upscaled to 4K so basically Dynamic 4K right?

Does this mean that in quality mode the games will run at 4K@30fps with ray-tracing and in performance mode, it will run in Dynamic 4K@60fps without downgrading graphical fidelity so raytracing still on?

Even if it is up to the dev, it seems that Miles Morales, Spider-Man Remastered, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Demon's Souls will have these 2 choices, they seem to be using Insomniac's Temporal Injection method,

&gt;which takes a lower internal resolution and uses prior/upcoming frames as well as AA to fill in the details to get a 4K image. It's another way of upscaling, like checkerboarding is, but temporal injection gives a cleaner image. Before DLSS 2.0 it was probably the best quality upscaling method.

I think PlayStation is letting Microsoft have the spotlight right now because once demonstrations of PS5 UI and loading into games happen it's going to drop jaws how fast PS5 really is.,"I'm sure you've heard how fast PS5 is Multiple times but reading the latest Gameinformer it blew me away. 

Kena Bridge of Spirits article one of the Game Informer staff got a hands on with actual PS5 hardware. He said he seen glimpse of the UI before the developer scrolled over the Kena game icon and hit play. 

He said the game loaded from PS5 Menu to gameplay in 2 Seconds. That's astounding. That's not loading into game seeing Menu then hitting play. That's hitting play from PS5 UI to game. 2 Seconds. Insane. 

This is probably old news but had to share anyway.


From Article

We start PS5s menu screen. Before I can see to much Mike moves over to the Kena Icon selects it and presses play. Two seconds later we're in the game. That's the load Josh says perhaps sensing my astonishment. They have a whole thing set up where you can do transitions and it's very nice,but frankly it doesn't have time to play the animation he adds. It just loads the game so fast.",t2_10cf08
"It seems that playing video games early has a great positive effect onto your memory, says this neuroscience study. So ready for the PS5?","While a number of studies have shown that video games can cause structural or functional changes in the brain, including the activation of areas responsible for attention or spatial and visual skills, this new work reveals lasting beneficial effects on memory when practiced in childhood. A recent study from Neuroscience researchers of the University of Barcelona finds that playing video games during childhood improves memory sustainably.

Study is available here: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full)

This new research, was carried out by a team of researchers from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and involving 27 subjects between the ages of 18 and 40, showed that beneficial cognitive changes could occur years after giving up playing games. video games.

I game since my very young age of 6, i can confirm that my memory still works fine at 40+. 

What about you? Did you start gaming long time ago? Are you going to start with PS5? Do you think that these studies should enable governments to support gaming better? Let's maybe having a super ministry/secretary (in US) of Sport and eSport? or of Video Games? (seriously...)

The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue.,"""Fair warning. This is going to be weirder that usual.""

So hear me out. I have been paying attention to this Yakuza issue with ps4 saves not transferring to ps5 and it seems it may not be the only game having this problem and by ommission and assumptions it's gone unnoticed.

I have to think that the issue has to be a technical one. There's no way an rpg that is crossplay wouldn't want to be cross-save as well. That makes me nervous about other games like AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk that are also crossplay.

Control got heat for only allowing the Ultimate edition to upgrade, but what if they knew the older version's saves wouldn't transfer either. Also the Spider-man remaster won't allow save transfer as well. So that's three.

I am no tech guy and this may be the concerns of an overthinker, but it bares considering that saves may not be as easy to transfer from one system to the other this time.

It could explain the new crunch time situation at CDPR after they promised they wouldn't. If they hit a snag like this they would grind their way to a solution (or they just told people what they wanted to hear).",t2_1dbv0e0c

With that in mind, I've thought about the possibility of the PS Store some time down the line offering trade ins. You buy a game at $70, and after you've decided you won't get any use out of it you have an option to delete it from your account forever for a small credit to the PS Store of like $10 or whatever.

I ended up just adding pretty much all of the album. Especially Marvel's Spider-Man &amp; Detroit Become Human (I know it's not exclusive any more)

Seems like Sony’s collaboration with AMD may have been successful,"I’ve seen quite few people speculating this in r/AMD 

[*Road to PS5 Presentation Mark Cerny says*](https://youtu.be/ph8LyNIT9sg?t=1564) - “If you see a similar discrete GPU available as a PC card at roughly the same time as we release our console, that means our collaboration with AMD succeeded.”

**Among other cards Navi 22 has been shown in a recent [leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/j06xcd/number_of_cus_of_navi_23_navi_31_van_gogh_cezanne/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) to have 40 CUs @ 2.5 GHz which is very similar to the PS5 GPU (36 CUs @ 2.23 GHz). PS5 has 90% of the CUs and 90% of the clockspeed.** 🤔

Does that mean he was likely referring to Navi 22 and the collaboration was successful? Maybe we’ll hear more in AMD’s upcoming event next month.

1440p 60fps is the way to go next gen,"Hear me out before keyboard warrioring please.

I've noticed a trend where 4K 60fps games as well as 4K 30fps games look like current gen visually(as in texture quality and the overall look of a game, not resolution). Examples of this are Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Godfall, Final Fantasy 16, Kena Bridge of spirits, Spider Man: Miles Morales and Halo Infinite. On the other hand you have very few games that genuinely look next gen. Like a handful at most. And one of these games is confirmed to run at 1440p(Demon Souls remake). Then you also have the unreal engine 5 tech demo(not a game but it still counts) which also runs at 1440p. The only other two I can think of is horizon forbidden west and black myth wukong. The former will probably be 4K 30fps knowing Sony but its going to be cross gen so a lot of power can be devoted to realistic graphics since its basically going to be an amped up version of a PS4 game. As for the latter, we do know that is 60fps and seems very unlikely to run at 4K on console judging by how advanced the graphics look compared to other next gen games. If games which look like PS4 games are bottlenecked at 4K 30 or 4K 60 there's no way in hell Black Myth Wukong can run 4K 60 so its most likely 1440p 60 like the tech demo and demon souls remake. 

Anyway, the bottom line is for a game to actually look like a genuine next gen game it has to be 1440p or sacrifice other areas like frame rate as well as being very limited in size which would be a huge turn off for some gamers such as myself who prioritise frame rate over resolution. 

1440p is a perfect compromise. 4K is a monolithic leap that is really unnecessary. Usually each gen the jump tends to be around 300p. PS1 to PS2 was 144p to 480p which is just over 300p. PS2 to PS3 was 480 to 720p which is a 240p jump. PS3 to PS4 was 720 to 1080p jump so 360p. If we go from 1080p to 1440p that would still be an above average leap at 360p difference. We all noticed the sharp resolution quality increase when we switched from 3 to 4 so why wouldn't the same happen with 1440p. 4K on the other hand is excessive. Why jump 1080 pixels all of a sudden? Not only is this uncalled for but like I said, it also sacrifices frame rate and ultimately weakens the graphical quality of games by using so much of the GPU's power so that the actual graphical quality of games look like last gen. 1440p 60fps is a much more well rounded solution that benefits everyone and is more beneficial towards both graphics and gameplay. Besides a needlessly large jump in resolution that people will get used to pretty quickly, there is nothing to lose from this.

Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013. What do you guys think how PS5 will perform throughout its life cycle?,"So this is more of a technical discussion I guess. I've been thinking a bit about the PS4 lately in an effort to understand how the PS5s life cycle may play out.

And basically three major questions have emerged:

1. was the PS4 really underpowered when it launched?

2. How come resolution and framerate didn't really get worse throughout its life cycle even as games became more visually impressive?

3. What does that mean for PS5?

I'd like to give my own two cents on this but I'm very curious to hear your takes on this since I most propably missed some stuff.

Was the PS4 underpowered? Looking back at 2013 I don't actually think it was. But the specs were certainly less impressive than PS5 today. Everyone (me included) constantly trashes PS4s CPU but at launch it was propably somewhere around Intel i3. Not too bad. The 1.84tf wasn't too bad either. Definitely not high end but still mid range. The 8gb of DDR5 on the other hand were really impressive. This was during a time when we were debating wether you needed 2gb of video RAM. All in all I'd say PS4 was a mid range system compared to PS5 which sits in the higher mid range.

So why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time? Especially during the Xbox360/PS3 era there was a clear trend towards games performing worse later in the generation. In 2006/7 you'd actually see some 720p 60fps AAA titles. Later on it was more like 540p25fps.

This didn't really happen for PS4 though and I don't really have an answer for that. At launch most PS4 games were ~900p 30fps and I can't say it has gotten much worse over time. In fact during 2015 I'd say performance actually got better with lots of games hitting 1080p30fps or 900p60fps. I don't really have an answer for this one since PS4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required years of experience to unlock its power. My guess is that games didn't get that much more demanding with PC gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals (judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example). This generation didn't really have a Crysis that completely blew away the status quo.

Now to my final question. What does that mean for PS5? While PS5 is more powerful than PS4 was back in the day I'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot.

If the life cycle does in fact turn out similarly to PS5 I think the status quo will be 4K 60fps without ray tracing and 30fps with ray tracing. However the UE5 demo from this summer tells a different story. It was super impressive but only ran at 1440p 30fps. I could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding. In that case I think it is absolutely crucial that PS5 has a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low res image to something that at least resembles 4K resolution. Otherwise I fear we will see the issue where lots of games will be ""dynamic 4K 30fps"" but will dip wayy below 4K most of the time, resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a 4K display.

What do you guys think about this? Did I miss something? Did I get something wrong? What's your take on PS4s performance throughout its life cycle and how do you anticipate PS5 will compare?",t2_5p6btf8r

Rise Gamers! Turkish Gamers are in a very bad situation. Please help us to get regional pricing,"Hi. Let me get straight to the point. I am asking for the help of all gamers around the world so Turkish Playstation users can also enjoy the great exclusives you guys do.  
  
Playstation Turkey recently increased the prices of some games to enormous amounts. For example, the new Avengers game costs 679 Turkish liras (87 US $) or Need for Speed Heat costs 709 Turkish liras (91 US $). So with these prices, we can only buy 3 games if we save all of our monthly minimum wage (2.324 Turkish liras). Let me also add that lots of people in Turkey earn a minimum wage because there is a  lack of jobs, even people who graduate from universities could end up in a minimum wage job which is not enough for anything.   
  
Let me also add that, this economical situation of our country is of course not the problem of Sony. We are also people just like you, I may or not support this goverment but I have the right to enjoy games as much as other people from other contries do. Just because I am born in this country, should not mean that I should not enjoy the things that you guys do. Other companies help with their pricing so we can also play games but Sony does not. For example 20$ indie games cost around 32 Turkish Liras on Steam so we can also enjoy them. Another example for Steam could be Cyberpunk 2077 costing 249 turkish liras. With these pricing examples, we can afford them by saving money for a few weeks/months. Microsoft also offers us Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for 45 Turkish Liras a month so we can enjoy as much as you guys do.  
  
But when it comes to Sony, they don't do anything. I also want to enjoy the new upcoming God of War Ragnarok or the new Demon's Souls but at this rate they are going to cost 800-900 turkish liras which is far from affordable. And even worse the PS5 is probably going to cost arond 8000 Turkish Liras (1020 US$) because of the heavy taxes of our country.  
  
What I am asking from Sony is to give Turkish players a regional pricing. If they don't want this because of the abuse that other gamers from other countries can do (buying from us because its cheaper) they could make it so that only people with Turkish ID's would be able to buy from the Turkish store.  
  
And from you guys and girls, from you fellow Gamers. I am asking for your support. Please support us so we can also enjoy that new God of War game, even that cute Bugsnax game together. I don't want to be forced to wait for the hope of getting these new games on ps plus when they come to that service 4 years later. I just want to enjoy these games together with my fellow gamers around the world.",t2_di948

Game boost mode for ps4 games,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

He was not talking about BC but Game boost mode for ps4 titles.

I understand that they wouldn't want to, but I'm not sure if it was possible, that as the games they make get more demanding and as they try to squeeze every last bit out of the system to make what they are trying to achieve, that the SSD can't keep up to the point we get back to longer load times again.

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling. Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is. I just think that this huge boost in speed will open the door to much more amazing and beautiful looking first party games with even bigger worlds and even more detailed environments than previously imagined for next generation.",t2_tlwzh7f

PS5 checkerboard rendering?,"With Digital Foundry's recent analysis of Demons Souls indicating a 1440p/60fps rendering target, it occurred to me that I don't recall hearing (and haven't been able to uncover) anything about a native checkerboarding solution for PS5. For those unaware, the PS4 Pro had dedicated hardware to interpolate and fill in missing pixels from incomplete 4K frames using previous frames (aka ""checkerboard rendering""), giving a much better visual approximation of 4K than upscaling, but without the performance cost of native 4K.

It seemed logical that Demon's Souls could *possibly* target a CB4k/60fps display if Sony has included similar checkerboarding hardware in the PS5. A partial 1920x2160 frame (whose missing 1920 horizontal pixels could be CB'ed to complete a full 4K frame) does contain 12% more pixels than a native 1440p one (4,147,200 pixels vs 3,686,400), but that does put it at least potentially within optimization reach for Demon's Souls. I would consider this somewhat unlikely for Demon's, given that Bluepoint is on record as preferring the simpler approach of temporal injection of 1440p into a 4K framebuffer in the Shadow of the Colossus remaster. Regardless, having the option of checkerboarding on the PS5 could put higher-detail performance modes within reach of many future titles, rather than forcing a strict compromise of ""performance = 1440p, detail = 4K"".

I can see why Sony might not have drawn attention to checkerboarding with the PS5, as it would likely stoke fanboy allegations of the console being too weak for ""real 4K"" etc, but given how well it was implemented in the PS4 Pro, it's hard for me to imagine them excluding it for any reason other than the already high expense of the hardware. I know there are robust software-based checkerboarding solutions out there, and 1440p titles from last-gen like Uncharted 4 / LL and TLoU2 did really well with their overall image quality and detail. But for me the PS4 Pro really proved that checkerboarding is the best technology outside of DLSS for getting high detail at a low performance cost, and if a game could offer me CB4K/60fps vs 1440p/60fps, I'd choose the former almost every time.",t2_l34q1c0

Demon’s Souls franchise potential,"With Sony holding the rights for Demon’s Souls, I’m curious if the success of the remake could make it possible for Bluepoint to create a sequel.

Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I’ve ever had. And here are my tips if you ever decide to camp out for one.,"As the title says, I’ve managed to secure a pre order at my GameStop to get my PS5, and I still can’t believe it honestly. Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it’s been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they’ll have available, if it’s okay to start a line overnight, what they’re store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don’t show up at 6AM thinking that you’re going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5’s available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don’t have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don’t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It’s going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what’s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other’s backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You’re all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who’s unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don’t be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it’ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who’s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that’s awesome, but if you don’t just make sure you don’t take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I’ll say this, I wasn’t going to go either, but something just told me “fuck it, if there aren’t any then just go back home”, but I’m telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you’ll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren’t able to secure a PS5, eventually you won’t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don’t lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can’t believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you’re local weather! Bring completely charged electronics &amp; of course wear your masks!",t2_6cu42drr
PS5 should let you set Home Screen music,"You know how you get the game soundtrack for certain digital deluxe games like The Last of us 2 and Ghost of Tsushima?

Why I think we'll see more 1st Party MP with next gen.,"With the anticipation for the TLOU MP I couldn't help but remembering 2yrs ago [Shawn Layden suggesting how much they will now invest in first party multiplayer titles](http://gametyrant.com/news/shawn-layden-wants-more-first-party-multiplayer-games-on-playstation) and I strongly believe TLOU MP will be the first of many:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What we don’t do so much in is multiplayer.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;But, no, I was referencing more with the things like “GTA 5 Online,” or you look at “Call of Duty,” or “Fortnite,” or any of those experiences. Worldwide Studios, like I say, we’ve been going really heavy into story-driven gaming. The power of the narrative. Big, spectacular experiences. But not a whole lot in the multiplayer side of things,  
&gt;  
&gt;**I think that’s an area where you will likely see us start to make more noise in the new term**.

&amp;#x200B;

Sony haven't seriously dabbled in the MP scenery, I mean yeah we had Killzone Shadow Fall, Driveclub but they were quickly forgotten.

That quote was 2yrs ago and I suspect things have already been in motion at WWS, perhaps that new SOCOM game isn't that unbelievable, a new Resistance or even bringing MAG back!

What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5,"Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.


&amp;nbsp;

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",t2_civ38

Now the thing is, we both want to play cyberpunk. But I don’t want to play until they release the PS5 version. So I won’t be playing now.

Would it make sense to buy the game at launch for PS4, and then loan it to my little bro to play. And then when the PS5 upgrade comes about, start playing it myself then? Would that work? Do I need to be careful about registering to my account first or something?

I hope PS5 will allow us to do this.(regarding save scumming),"on PS4 if you want to back up a save to USB you have to close the game to do the back up task, that's really irritating especially when you go after 2 or more conflicting Trophies (i.e. Endings) or when forging an equipment which have RNG skills and you are looking for a specific skill on that equipment until you're running out of resources if you didn't get what you want you can go to your backed up save. i know PS5 can boot up games fast and i'll be where i left the game in few seconds after backing up my save but still doing that without shutting down the game is more convenient for us Save-Scummers.

Gfn is a great service don't get me wrong and has given me access to a lot of my old steam games (having no suitable pc) but after having virtually all my fighting games removed along with all my racing games, enough is enough. Gfn plays perfectly well and gives reasonable graphics at 1080p, but it's not without its faults. Small amounts of lag, sub par rigs for certain games - these are all problems I am looking to overcome with getting a ps5. Finally I will be able to buy a game, knowing it won't be removed, play it without lag, and enjoy 4k.

So I was wondering, who else is in the same position or who is a renegade from stadia?",t2_1f4f8i8l

Sony should capitalize on gyro-aiming this generation.,"Gyro aiming is a way of minimizing the precision gap between controllers versus mouse&amp;keyboard. The use of gyro aiming doesn't replace the the right analog stick, but instead is used merely for fine-tuning. For those unfamiliar, here are a few videos illustrating in different ways its surprising potential for shooter games:

————

[\[Halo with gyro aiming\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqaz6SxnwnI&amp;t=1s)

[\[Linus Tech Tips\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qlZmXnE1mw)

[\[Motion Controls and the Rejection of Progress\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=binPB4YbWmM&amp;ab_channel=Nerrel)

————

 Unfortunately, gyro aiming is often misunderstood. Here are common arguments I see against it, and why they aren't compelling:

**I wouldn't use it.** That's fine. But others would like to, and making it optional can leave everyone happy.

**It shouldn't be mandatory.** To my knowledge, no shooter has ever made gyro aiming mandatory.

**It would be expensive.** Gyro sensors are relatively inexpensive and wouldn't require any novel technology.

**It hinders accessibility.** More options increases accessibility.

**It's a gimmick.** Gyro aiming requires minimal movement and provides enhanced precision, unlike certain previous implementations of motion controls that have rightly been regarded as gimmicky.

**Not enough people care about it.** That's quickly changing as more and more people come to realize its potential.

————

On the other hand, there are good arguments in favor of gyro aiming. Most importantly, joysticks are intrinsically limited for aiming; gyro aiming enables a finer degree of precision. This

* fine-tunes the controls.
* enhances player agency.
* raises the skill ceiling without necessarily raising the skill floor.
* reduces the need to rely on auto-aim as a crutch.

————

One of the significant but underappreciated differences between the PS5 and XBX is that the PS5's controller enables gyro-aiming while the XBX's controller does not. However, there's been little effort by Sony to capitalize on this advantage. This is nothing new—the PS4 controller has a gyro sensor, but gyro aiming often wasn't even implemented in PS4's first-person shooters. This strikes me as a missed opportunity.

If you agree, I suggest reaching out to Sony via social media. The technology is already there—it's just up to Sony to take advantage of it.",t2_gxwjj

(Unpopular Opinion?) There is absolutely not a lack of content or information coming from Sony,"First let me say that I've enjoyed hanging out on this subreddit during the build up to PS5 and I've seen some really great posts on here, in fact I changed from a long time lurker to poster because of this sub!

I must say however that recently (especially the last week), I've seen several people commenting that there's nothing coming from Sony and they're getting frustrated with the lack of info.

I'm not sure if its because I'm an older gamer (started on snes for reference lol) but this comes across as such impatience to me when I see it. Am I the only one still riding the hype from the showcase that was exactly 2 weeks ago? 

Not to mention the continuous blog posts giving more tid bits. Sure they've not shown the UI but what they have shown me is great looking games that I cant wait to play.

And you know what? I had no idea what the UI on any console I've ever owned would look like before I switched it on and I honestly think it adds to the wonder of using your shiny new console for the very first time. Surpises can be great!

Help me understand Ray Tracing (Spider-Man PS4 remastered) Honest question.," I'm not a pc gamer, so I'm not used to Ray Tracing. 

So from what I heard and know, Ray Tracing allow light to better reflects on surface and to create better reflection. (I can be wrong) 

And as you all know, today this photo of Spider-Man Ps4 remastered came to life. 

[https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv](https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv)

But I feel like there's something wrong.

With how high Peter is and that camera angle, is that normal to see all the street and the pedestrians below him? 

And also is Ray Tracing supposed to be ""like a mirror""? I mean is it supposed to have a 100% reflection of what is on the other side/angle? Is it too exaggerated in the photo or is this really what is Ray Tracing? 

I feel like this is just because it's the beggining of it on consoles so Devs doesn't have a standpoint (except on Pc)

All good things come to those people who wait,"Hello 

I hope you are having a safe journey through 2020. I have seen many posts regarding PlayStation’s silence and wanted to add something to the discussion. So here it goes: 

One thing I know from Sony and PlayStation’s marketing team is they are Marketing Gods amongst men. They know that selling something when it’s sold out is not the best idea. 

There is even a study from University of Alberta and according to them 

“An empty store shelf tempts shoppers to buy the next best thing” 

This means if they start advertising without any stock they might end up selling more of their competitors products. 

In addition, in my opinion PS5’s 

The Load times are better 

The controller is better 

The launch games are better 

The first year games are better 

The third party support is better

Backwards compatible first party games are better 

The UI is better (subjective) 

Also just saying combined with the two IO co processors the CPU is going to be better 

In addition with the cache scrubbers and the higher clock speed on the GPU is going to run better 

All in all just wait all good things will come to those who wait. Only 6 weeks to go.

Well as much as this and game patches were annoying on PS4 having to wait for install, because of the blazing SSD (Cerny Preach) hopefully we’ll all be up and running with our PS5s pretty fast (or better yet.. background updates!?)  *Good internet required*",t2_7eebvuwi

Considering you get ultimate edition Watch Dogs 1 with the purchase Ultimate Edition for Watch Dogs Legion (Might be wrong edition) wouldn't it be cool to see an improved upon E3 graphical build of the game?

Anyone else dislike the subscription model for games?,"Maybe I’m in the minority here but I feel there isn’t enough discussion about this. 

I’m not a big fan of the Netflix-like subscription model for games. 
I was really excited to try out services like PS Now/Game pass, but unfortunately I never touched 90% of the mediocre games they offer in the library. 

Maybe it’s just me or how I treat video games as a form of entertainment. 
It’s not like watching an average popcorn flick on Netflix and have a good time. 
I just can’t invest my time in a mediocre game and have fun. There’s nothing worse than playing a bad game. 

There are some occasional big games added to the library and majority of the users seem to be waiting only for those. And this seriously raises doubts about the value for money aspect with these subscription models. 

I really love the monthly free games offered on PlayStation Plus because for most months, they do give decent games. But this subscription model just doesn’t seem to click with me.",t2_zm0ecm7

Sony should add Google Drive/Dropbox backup for screenshots and videos on PS5,"It would help a lot if we could backup screenshots and videos to Google Drive or Dropbox so it is easier to grab them on our PCs/smartphones.

The only alteranative for videos is sending them to Youtube and download them later.

I hope Sony allows us to link our Google or Dropbox accounts on PS5 so we can make auto/manual backups. It will probably take a long time but I hope they at least consider it throughout PS5 lifecycle.

First-Party Titles Run At 4K@30 or Dynamic 4K@60?,"So on the Spider-Man Remastered page, it says, [Link](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered/);

&gt;Experience the critically acclaimed hit with updated graphical assets and in stunning dynamic 4K/HDR\*. And experience swinging through New York and combat as an experienced Spider-Man with an optional performance mode that takes advantage of Insomniac’s temporal injection for dynamic 4K/60fps\*.

We have also been told that;

&gt;and the same optional performance mode offered on Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, allowing you to finally play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate.

We also know that Demon's Souls, at least in the trailer, according to DF was rendering internally at 1440p and then upscaled to 4K so basically Dynamic 4K right?

Does this mean that in quality mode the games will run at 4K@30fps with ray-tracing and in performance mode, it will run in Dynamic 4K@60fps without downgrading graphical fidelity so raytracing still on?

Even if it is up to the dev, it seems that Miles Morales, Spider-Man Remastered, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Demon's Souls will have these 2 choices, they seem to be using Insomniac's Temporal Injection method,

&gt;which takes a lower internal resolution and uses prior/upcoming frames as well as AA to fill in the details to get a 4K image. It's another way of upscaling, like checkerboarding is, but temporal injection gives a cleaner image. Before DLSS 2.0 it was probably the best quality upscaling method.

I think PlayStation is letting Microsoft have the spotlight right now because once demonstrations of PS5 UI and loading into games happen it's going to drop jaws how fast PS5 really is.,"I'm sure you've heard how fast PS5 is Multiple times but reading the latest Gameinformer it blew me away. 

Kena Bridge of Spirits article one of the Game Informer staff got a hands on with actual PS5 hardware. He said he seen glimpse of the UI before the developer scrolled over the Kena game icon and hit play. 

He said the game loaded from PS5 Menu to gameplay in 2 Seconds. That's astounding. That's not loading into game seeing Menu then hitting play. That's hitting play from PS5 UI to game. 2 Seconds. Insane. 

This is probably old news but had to share anyway.


From Article

We start PS5s menu screen. Before I can see to much Mike moves over to the Kena Icon selects it and presses play. Two seconds later we're in the game. That's the load Josh says perhaps sensing my astonishment. They have a whole thing set up where you can do transitions and it's very nice,but frankly it doesn't have time to play the animation he adds. It just loads the game so fast.",t2_10cf08
"It seems that playing video games early has a great positive effect onto your memory, says this neuroscience study. So ready for the PS5?","While a number of studies have shown that video games can cause structural or functional changes in the brain, including the activation of areas responsible for attention or spatial and visual skills, this new work reveals lasting beneficial effects on memory when practiced in childhood. A recent study from Neuroscience researchers of the University of Barcelona finds that playing video games during childhood improves memory sustainably.

Study is available here: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full)

This new research, was carried out by a team of researchers from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and involving 27 subjects between the ages of 18 and 40, showed that beneficial cognitive changes could occur years after giving up playing games. video games.

I game since my very young age of 6, i can confirm that my memory still works fine at 40+. 

What about you? Did you start gaming long time ago? Are you going to start with PS5? Do you think that these studies should enable governments to support gaming better? Let's maybe having a super ministry/secretary (in US) of Sport and eSport? or of Video Games? (seriously...)

The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue.,"""Fair warning. This is going to be weirder that usual.""

So hear me out. I have been paying attention to this Yakuza issue with ps4 saves not transferring to ps5 and it seems it may not be the only game having this problem and by ommission and assumptions it's gone unnoticed.

I have to think that the issue has to be a technical one. There's no way an rpg that is crossplay wouldn't want to be cross-save as well. That makes me nervous about other games like AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk that are also crossplay.

Control got heat for only allowing the Ultimate edition to upgrade, but what if they knew the older version's saves wouldn't transfer either. Also the Spider-man remaster won't allow save transfer as well. So that's three.

I am no tech guy and this may be the concerns of an overthinker, but it bares considering that saves may not be as easy to transfer from one system to the other this time.

It could explain the new crunch time situation at CDPR after they promised they wouldn't. If they hit a snag like this they would grind their way to a solution (or they just told people what they wanted to hear).",t2_1dbv0e0c

With that in mind, I've thought about the possibility of the PS Store some time down the line offering trade ins. You buy a game at $70, and after you've decided you won't get any use out of it you have an option to delete it from your account forever for a small credit to the PS Store of like $10 or whatever.

I hope the tradition for PS4 exclusives to have incredible soundtracks carries over to the PS5,"I've only had a PS4, none of the PlayStation's before, so I'm only judging on the current gen of exclusives.

I personally think that the current gen PS exclusives have had some of, if not the best soundtracks I've ever heard in games. So I hope that the PS5 exclusives will continue having incredible soundtracks. 

Most of the time I'd say there's a couples tracks from each album that I'd listen outside of the game, but when I was making a Spotify playlist with game music. I ended up just adding pretty much all of the album. Especially Marvel's Spider-Man &amp; Detroit Become Human (I know it's not exclusive any more)

Here's some of the tracks from games that I think are incredible are warent them being some of the best.

Ultimately, I hopped on kijiji and unfortunately paid an extra cost of $70 or so to grab one from someone who was reselling higher. I didn’t know much about the term “scalping” etc that many years ago nor did I care. I just wanted the console and I was happy. I bought 2 additional controllers, and a camera.

Seems like Sony’s collaboration with AMD may have been successful,"I’ve seen quite few people speculating this in r/AMD 

[*Road to PS5 Presentation Mark Cerny says*](https://youtu.be/ph8LyNIT9sg?t=1564) - “If you see a similar discrete GPU available as a PC card at roughly the same time as we release our console, that means our collaboration with AMD succeeded.”

**Among other cards Navi 22 has been shown in a recent [leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/j06xcd/number_of_cus_of_navi_23_navi_31_van_gogh_cezanne/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) to have 40 CUs @ 2.5 GHz which is very similar to the PS5 GPU (36 CUs @ 2.23 GHz). PS5 has 90% of the CUs and 90% of the clockspeed.** 🤔

Does that mean he was likely referring to Navi 22 and the collaboration was successful? Maybe we’ll hear more in AMD’s upcoming event next month.

1440p 60fps is the way to go next gen,"Hear me out before keyboard warrioring please.

I've noticed a trend where 4K 60fps games as well as 4K 30fps games look like current gen visually(as in texture quality and the overall look of a game, not resolution). Examples of this are Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Godfall, Final Fantasy 16, Kena Bridge of spirits, Spider Man: Miles Morales and Halo Infinite. On the other hand you have very few games that genuinely look next gen. Like a handful at most. And one of these games is confirmed to run at 1440p(Demon Souls remake). Then you also have the unreal engine 5 tech demo(not a game but it still counts) which also runs at 1440p. The only other two I can think of is horizon forbidden west and black myth wukong. The former will probably be 4K 30fps knowing Sony but its going to be cross gen so a lot of power can be devoted to realistic graphics since its basically going to be an amped up version of a PS4 game. As for the latter, we do know that is 60fps and seems very unlikely to run at 4K on console judging by how advanced the graphics look compared to other next gen games. If games which look like PS4 games are bottlenecked at 4K 30 or 4K 60 there's no way in hell Black Myth Wukong can run 4K 60 so its most likely 1440p 60 like the tech demo and demon souls remake. 

Anyway, the bottom line is for a game to actually look like a genuine next gen game it has to be 1440p or sacrifice other areas like frame rate as well as being very limited in size which would be a huge turn off for some gamers such as myself who prioritise frame rate over resolution. 

1440p is a perfect compromise. 4K is a monolithic leap that is really unnecessary. Usually each gen the jump tends to be around 300p. PS1 to PS2 was 144p to 480p which is just over 300p. PS2 to PS3 was 480 to 720p which is a 240p jump. PS3 to PS4 was 720 to 1080p jump so 360p. If we go from 1080p to 1440p that would still be an above average leap at 360p difference. We all noticed the sharp resolution quality increase when we switched from 3 to 4 so why wouldn't the same happen with 1440p. 4K on the other hand is excessive. Why jump 1080 pixels all of a sudden? Not only is this uncalled for but like I said, it also sacrifices frame rate and ultimately weakens the graphical quality of games by using so much of the GPU's power so that the actual graphical quality of games look like last gen. 1440p 60fps is a much more well rounded solution that benefits everyone and is more beneficial towards both graphics and gameplay. Besides a needlessly large jump in resolution that people will get used to pretty quickly, there is nothing to lose from this.

Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013. What do you guys think how PS5 will perform throughout its life cycle?,"So this is more of a technical discussion I guess. I've been thinking a bit about the PS4 lately in an effort to understand how the PS5s life cycle may play out.

And basically three major questions have emerged:

1. was the PS4 really underpowered when it launched?

2. How come resolution and framerate didn't really get worse throughout its life cycle even as games became more visually impressive?

3. What does that mean for PS5?

I'd like to give my own two cents on this but I'm very curious to hear your takes on this since I most propably missed some stuff.

Was the PS4 underpowered? Looking back at 2013 I don't actually think it was. But the specs were certainly less impressive than PS5 today. Everyone (me included) constantly trashes PS4s CPU but at launch it was propably somewhere around Intel i3. Not too bad. The 1.84tf wasn't too bad either. Definitely not high end but still mid range. The 8gb of DDR5 on the other hand were really impressive. This was during a time when we were debating wether you needed 2gb of video RAM. All in all I'd say PS4 was a mid range system compared to PS5 which sits in the higher mid range.

So why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time? Especially during the Xbox360/PS3 era there was a clear trend towards games performing worse later in the generation. In 2006/7 you'd actually see some 720p 60fps AAA titles. Later on it was more like 540p25fps.

This didn't really happen for PS4 though and I don't really have an answer for that. At launch most PS4 games were ~900p 30fps and I can't say it has gotten much worse over time. In fact during 2015 I'd say performance actually got better with lots of games hitting 1080p30fps or 900p60fps. I don't really have an answer for this one since PS4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required years of experience to unlock its power. My guess is that games didn't get that much more demanding with PC gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals (judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example). This generation didn't really have a Crysis that completely blew away the status quo.

Now to my final question. What does that mean for PS5? While PS5 is more powerful than PS4 was back in the day I'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot.

If the life cycle does in fact turn out similarly to PS5 I think the status quo will be 4K 60fps without ray tracing and 30fps with ray tracing. However the UE5 demo from this summer tells a different story. It was super impressive but only ran at 1440p 30fps. I could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding. In that case I think it is absolutely crucial that PS5 has a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low res image to something that at least resembles 4K resolution. Otherwise I fear we will see the issue where lots of games will be ""dynamic 4K 30fps"" but will dip wayy below 4K most of the time, resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a 4K display.

What do you guys think about this? Did I miss something? Did I get something wrong? What's your take on PS4s performance throughout its life cycle and how do you anticipate PS5 will compare?",t2_5p6btf8r

Rise Gamers! Turkish Gamers are in a very bad situation. Please help us to get regional pricing,"Hi. Let me get straight to the point. I am asking for the help of all gamers around the world so Turkish Playstation users can also enjoy the great exclusives you guys do.  
  
Playstation Turkey recently increased the prices of some games to enormous amounts. For example, the new Avengers game costs 679 Turkish liras (87 US $) or Need for Speed Heat costs 709 Turkish liras (91 US $). So with these prices, we can only buy 3 games if we save all of our monthly minimum wage (2.324 Turkish liras). Let me also add that lots of people in Turkey earn a minimum wage because there is a  lack of jobs, even people who graduate from universities could end up in a minimum wage job which is not enough for anything.   
  
Let me also add that, this economical situation of our country is of course not the problem of Sony. We are also people just like you, I may or not support this goverment but I have the right to enjoy games as much as other people from other contries do. Just because I am born in this country, should not mean that I should not enjoy the things that you guys do. Other companies help with their pricing so we can also play games but Sony does not. For example 20$ indie games cost around 32 Turkish Liras on Steam so we can also enjoy them. Another example for Steam could be Cyberpunk 2077 costing 249 turkish liras. With these pricing examples, we can afford them by saving money for a few weeks/months. Microsoft also offers us Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for 45 Turkish Liras a month so we can enjoy as much as you guys do.  
  
But when it comes to Sony, they don't do anything. I also want to enjoy the new upcoming God of War Ragnarok or the new Demon's Souls but at this rate they are going to cost 800-900 turkish liras which is far from affordable. And even worse the PS5 is probably going to cost arond 8000 Turkish Liras (1020 US$) because of the heavy taxes of our country.  
  
What I am asking from Sony is to give Turkish players a regional pricing. If they don't want this because of the abuse that other gamers from other countries can do (buying from us because its cheaper) they could make it so that only people with Turkish ID's would be able to buy from the Turkish store.  
  
And from you guys and girls, from you fellow Gamers. I am asking for your support. Please support us so we can also enjoy that new God of War game, even that cute Bugsnax game together. I don't want to be forced to wait for the hope of getting these new games on ps plus when they come to that service 4 years later. I just want to enjoy these games together with my fellow gamers around the world.",t2_di948

Game boost mode for ps4 games,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

He was not talking about BC but Game boost mode for ps4 titles.

I understand that they wouldn't want to, but I'm not sure if it was possible, that as the games they make get more demanding and as they try to squeeze every last bit out of the system to make what they are trying to achieve, that the SSD can't keep up to the point we get back to longer load times again. I only say this because it's like on any new system, it starts out fast but as time goes on it starts to get slower to the point where menus are a bit more laggy etc.",t2_zh5di

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling. Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is. I just think that this huge boost in speed will open the door to much more amazing and beautiful looking first party games with even bigger worlds and even more detailed environments than previously imagined for next generation.",t2_tlwzh7f

PS5 checkerboard rendering?,"With Digital Foundry's recent analysis of Demons Souls indicating a 1440p/60fps rendering target, it occurred to me that I don't recall hearing (and haven't been able to uncover) anything about a native checkerboarding solution for PS5. For those unaware, the PS4 Pro had dedicated hardware to interpolate and fill in missing pixels from incomplete 4K frames using previous frames (aka ""checkerboard rendering""), giving a much better visual approximation of 4K than upscaling, but without the performance cost of native 4K.

It seemed logical that Demon's Souls could *possibly* target a CB4k/60fps display if Sony has included similar checkerboarding hardware in the PS5. A partial 1920x2160 frame (whose missing 1920 horizontal pixels could be CB'ed to complete a full 4K frame) does contain 12% more pixels than a native 1440p one (4,147,200 pixels vs 3,686,400), but that does put it at least potentially within optimization reach for Demon's Souls. I would consider this somewhat unlikely for Demon's, given that Bluepoint is on record as preferring the simpler approach of temporal injection of 1440p into a 4K framebuffer in the Shadow of the Colossus remaster. Regardless, having the option of checkerboarding on the PS5 could put higher-detail performance modes within reach of many future titles, rather than forcing a strict compromise of ""performance = 1440p, detail = 4K"".

I can see why Sony might not have drawn attention to checkerboarding with the PS5, as it would likely stoke fanboy allegations of the console being too weak for ""real 4K"" etc, but given how well it was implemented in the PS4 Pro, it's hard for me to imagine them excluding it for any reason other than the already high expense of the hardware. I know there are robust software-based checkerboarding solutions out there, and 1440p titles from last-gen like Uncharted 4 / LL and TLoU2 did really well with their overall image quality and detail. But for me the PS4 Pro really proved that checkerboarding is the best technology outside of DLSS for getting high detail at a low performance cost, and if a game could offer me CB4K/60fps vs 1440p/60fps, I'd choose the former almost every time.",t2_l34q1c0

Do I understand this correct? Buying PS4 versions at PS5 launch...,"Hi Guys, help me make sure I am on the right track please - getting my son a PS5, but he won't always have access to it - he will have access to the PS4 if he can't get on the PS5. He loves the Spiderman game on the PS4 so i'm grabbing him Miles Morales launch edition. Also plan on getting watchdogs, cyberpunk and maybe assassins's creed as well - BUT I will be buying all of these as PS4 versions though... If I read and understand everything correctly they will all upgrade to/or playable on PS5, but if I get the PS4 version he can play them on either the PS4 or PS5. Added bonus the PS4 versions are cheaper. Am I on the right track? Thanks in advance.

Clearing up PS5 confusions,"1. The PS5 SSD is not that special the component that makes the SSD special is the IO complex. For example this IO complex is responsible for decompression which frees the CPU to process gameplay data. 

2. 99% of PS4 games will work on PS5 via backwards compatibility. This means if you insert your PS4 Spider-Man copy or download your digital PS4 copy you will be able to play it from day one. 

3. Spider-Man that comes with Miles Morales is a Remaster and this is completely different than increasing few settings in a options menu. This remaster includes ray tracing, new assets, increased city density and it took many developers time and effort. 

4. PS4 controller DualShock 4 is only able to play PS4 games on PS5. The reason why we are not able to play PS5 only games with DualShock 4 is that the PS5 only games are designed to fully utilise the DualSense controller that includes gameplay functions.",t2_13cvoc

Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I’ve ever had. And here are my tips if you ever decide to camp out for one.,"As the title says, I’ve managed to secure a pre order at my GameStop to get my PS5, and I still can’t believe it honestly. Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it’s been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they’ll have available, if it’s okay to start a line overnight, what they’re store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don’t show up at 6AM thinking that you’re going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5’s available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don’t have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don’t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It’s going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what’s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other’s backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You’re all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who’s unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don’t be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it’ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who’s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that’s awesome, but if you don’t just make sure you don’t take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I’ll say this, I wasn’t going to go either, but something just told me “fuck it, if there aren’t any then just go back home”, but I’m telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you’ll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren’t able to secure a PS5, eventually you won’t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don’t lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can’t believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you’re local weather! Bring completely charged electronics &amp; of course wear your masks!",t2_6cu42drr
PS5 should let you set Home Screen music,"You know how you get the game soundtrack for certain digital deluxe games like The Last of us 2 and Ghost of Tsushima?

Why I think we'll see more 1st Party MP with next gen.,"With the anticipation for the TLOU MP I couldn't help but remembering 2yrs ago [Shawn Layden suggesting how much they will now invest in first party multiplayer titles](http://gametyrant.com/news/shawn-layden-wants-more-first-party-multiplayer-games-on-playstation) and I strongly believe TLOU MP will be the first of many:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What we don’t do so much in is multiplayer.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;But, no, I was referencing more with the things like “GTA 5 Online,” or you look at “Call of Duty,” or “Fortnite,” or any of those experiences. Worldwide Studios, like I say, we’ve been going really heavy into story-driven gaming. The power of the narrative. Big, spectacular experiences. But not a whole lot in the multiplayer side of things,  
&gt;  
&gt;**I think that’s an area where you will likely see us start to make more noise in the new term**.

&amp;#x200B;

Sony haven't seriously dabbled in the MP scenery, I mean yeah we had Killzone Shadow Fall, Driveclub but they were quickly forgotten.

That quote was 2yrs ago and I suspect things have already been in motion at WWS, perhaps that new SOCOM game isn't that unbelievable, a new Resistance or even bringing MAG back!

What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5,"Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.


&amp;nbsp;

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",t2_civ38

Now the thing is, we both want to play cyberpunk. But I don’t want to play until they release the PS5 version. So I won’t be playing now.

Would it make sense to buy the game at launch for PS4, and then loan it to my little bro to play. And then when the PS5 upgrade comes about, start playing it myself then? Would that work? Do I need to be careful about registering to my account first or something?

I hope PS5 will allow us to do this.(regarding save scumming),"on PS4 if you want to back up a save to USB you have to close the game to do the back up task, that's really irritating especially when you go after 2 or more conflicting Trophies (i.e. Endings) or when forging an equipment which have RNG skills and you are looking for a specific skill on that equipment until you're running out of resources if you didn't get what you want you can go to your backed up save. i know PS5 can boot up games fast and i'll be where i left the game in few seconds after backing up my save but still doing that without shutting down the game is more convenient for us Save-Scummers.
Sorry for any grammar mistake, English isn't my mother tongue.

TL;DR i hope PS5 allows us to back up saves to USB while the game is still running.",t2_11qhec

I opened up my PS4 last week and the disc unit is massive and now I'm wondering what implications/benefits its absence could bring to a console.

Who here is refugee from geforce now?,"After using gfn for nearly 3 years and having virtually all of my favourite games removed from the service - I am coming to ps5 so I have more actual ownership of my games. Gfn is a great service don't get me wrong and has given me access to a lot of my old steam games (having no suitable pc) but after having virtually all my fighting games removed along with all my racing games, enough is enough. Gfn plays perfectly well and gives reasonable graphics at 1080p, but it's not without its faults. Small amounts of lag, sub par rigs for certain games - these are all problems I am looking to overcome with getting a ps5.

Sony should capitalize on gyro-aiming this generation.,"Gyro aiming is a way of minimizing the precision gap between controllers versus mouse&amp;keyboard. The use of gyro aiming doesn't replace the the right analog stick, but instead is used merely for fine-tuning. For those unfamiliar, here are a few videos illustrating in different ways its surprising potential for shooter games:

————

[\[Halo with gyro aiming\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqaz6SxnwnI&amp;t=1s)

[\[Linus Tech Tips\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qlZmXnE1mw)

[\[Motion Controls and the Rejection of Progress\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=binPB4YbWmM&amp;ab_channel=Nerrel)

————

 Unfortunately, gyro aiming is often misunderstood. Here are common arguments I see against it, and why they aren't compelling:

**I wouldn't use it.** That's fine. But others would like to, and making it optional can leave everyone happy.

**It shouldn't be mandatory.** To my knowledge, no shooter has ever made gyro aiming mandatory.

**It would be expensive.** Gyro sensors are relatively inexpensive and wouldn't require any novel technology.

**It hinders accessibility.** More options increases accessibility.

**It's a gimmick.** Gyro aiming requires minimal movement and provides enhanced precision, unlike certain previous implementations of motion controls that have rightly been regarded as gimmicky.

**Not enough people care about it.** That's quickly changing as more and more people come to realize its potential.

————

On the other hand, there are good arguments in favor of gyro aiming. Most importantly, joysticks are intrinsically limited for aiming; gyro aiming enables a finer degree of precision. This

* fine-tunes the controls.
* enhances player agency.
* raises the skill ceiling without necessarily raising the skill floor.
* reduces the need to rely on auto-aim as a crutch.

————

One of the significant but underappreciated differences between the PS5 and XBX is that the PS5's controller enables gyro-aiming while the XBX's controller does not. However, there's been little effort by Sony to capitalize on this advantage. This is nothing new—the PS4 controller has a gyro sensor, but gyro aiming often wasn't even implemented in PS4's first-person shooters. This strikes me as a missed opportunity.

If you agree, I suggest reaching out to Sony via social media. The technology is already there—it's just up to Sony to take advantage of it.",t2_gxwjj

(Unpopular Opinion?) There is absolutely not a lack of content or information coming from Sony,"First let me say that I've enjoyed hanging out on this subreddit during the build up to PS5 and I've seen some really great posts on here, in fact I changed from a long time lurker to poster because of this sub!

I must say however that recently (especially the last week), I've seen several people commenting that there's nothing coming from Sony and they're getting frustrated with the lack of info.

I'm not sure if its because I'm an older gamer (started on snes for reference lol) but this comes across as such impatience to me when I see it. Am I the only one still riding the hype from the showcase that was exactly 2 weeks ago? 

Not to mention the continuous blog posts giving more tid bits. Sure they've not shown the UI but what they have shown me is great looking games that I cant wait to play.

And you know what? I had no idea what the UI on any console I've ever owned would look like before I switched it on and I honestly think it adds to the wonder of using your shiny new console for the very first time. Surpises can be great!

Help me understand Ray Tracing (Spider-Man PS4 remastered) Honest question.," I'm not a pc gamer, so I'm not used to Ray Tracing. 

So from what I heard and know, Ray Tracing allow light to better reflects on surface and to create better reflection. (I can be wrong) 

And as you all know, today this photo of Spider-Man Ps4 remastered came to life. 

[https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv](https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv)

But I feel like there's something wrong.

With how high Peter is and that camera angle, is that normal to see all the street and the pedestrians below him? 

And also is Ray Tracing supposed to be ""like a mirror""? I mean is it supposed to have a 100% reflection of what is on the other side/angle? Is it too exaggerated in the photo or is this really what is Ray Tracing?

All good things come to those people who wait,"Hello 

I hope you are having a safe journey through 2020. I have seen many posts regarding PlayStation’s silence and wanted to add something to the discussion. So here it goes: 

One thing I know from Sony and PlayStation’s marketing team is they are Marketing Gods amongst men. They know that selling something when it’s sold out is not the best idea. 

There is even a study from University of Alberta and according to them 

“An empty store shelf tempts shoppers to buy the next best thing” 

This means if they start advertising without any stock they might end up selling more of their competitors products. 

In addition, in my opinion PS5’s 

The Load times are better 

The controller is better 

The launch games are better 

The first year games are better 

The third party support is better

Backwards compatible first party games are better 

The UI is better (subjective) 

Also just saying combined with the two IO co processors the CPU is going to be better 

In addition with the cache scrubbers and the higher clock speed on the GPU is going to run better 

All in all just wait all good things will come to those who wait. Only 6 weeks to go.

Considering you get ultimate edition Watch Dogs 1 with the purchase Ultimate Edition for Watch Dogs Legion (Might be wrong edition) wouldn't it be cool to see an improved upon E3 graphical build of the game?

Anyone else dislike the subscription model for games?,"Maybe I’m in the minority here but I feel there isn’t enough discussion about this. 

I’m not a big fan of the Netflix-like subscription model for games. 
I was really excited to try out services like PS Now/Game pass, but unfortunately I never touched 90% of the mediocre games they offer in the library. 

Maybe it’s just me or how I treat video games as a form of entertainment. 
It’s not like watching an average popcorn flick on Netflix and have a good time. 
I just can’t invest my time in a mediocre game and have fun. There’s nothing worse than playing a bad game. 

There are some occasional big games added to the library and majority of the users seem to be waiting only for those. And this seriously raises doubts about the value for money aspect with these subscription models. 

I really love the monthly free games offered on PlayStation Plus because for most months, they do give decent games. But this subscription model just doesn’t seem to click with me.",t2_zm0ecm7

Sony should add Google Drive/Dropbox backup for screenshots and videos on PS5,"It would help a lot if we could backup screenshots and videos to Google Drive or Dropbox so it is easier to grab them on our PCs/smartphones.

The only alteranative for videos is sending them to Youtube and download them later.

I hope Sony allows us to link our Google or Dropbox accounts on PS5 so we can make auto/manual backups. It will probably take a long time but I hope they at least consider it throughout PS5 lifecycle.

First-Party Titles Run At 4K@30 or Dynamic 4K@60?,"So on the Spider-Man Remastered page, it says, [Link](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered/);

&gt;Experience the critically acclaimed hit with updated graphical assets and in stunning dynamic 4K/HDR\*. And experience swinging through New York and combat as an experienced Spider-Man with an optional performance mode that takes advantage of Insomniac’s temporal injection for dynamic 4K/60fps\*.

We have also been told that;

&gt;and the same optional performance mode offered on Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, allowing you to finally play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate.

We also know that Demon's Souls, at least in the trailer, according to DF was rendering internally at 1440p and then upscaled to 4K so basically Dynamic 4K right?

Does this mean that in quality mode the games will run at 4K@30fps with ray-tracing and in performance mode, it will run in Dynamic 4K@60fps without downgrading graphical fidelity so raytracing still on?

Even if it is up to the dev, it seems that Miles Morales, Spider-Man Remastered, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Demon's Souls will have these 2 choices, they seem to be using Insomniac's Temporal Injection method,

&gt;which takes a lower internal resolution and uses prior/upcoming frames as well as AA to fill in the details to get a 4K image. It's another way of upscaling, like checkerboarding is, but temporal injection gives a cleaner image. Before DLSS 2.0 it was probably the best quality upscaling method.

I think PlayStation is letting Microsoft have the spotlight right now because once demonstrations of PS5 UI and loading into games happen it's going to drop jaws how fast PS5 really is.,"I'm sure you've heard how fast PS5 is Multiple times but reading the latest Gameinformer it blew me away. 

Kena Bridge of Spirits article one of the Game Informer staff got a hands on with actual PS5 hardware. He said he seen glimpse of the UI before the developer scrolled over the Kena game icon and hit play. 

He said the game loaded from PS5 Menu to gameplay in 2 Seconds. That's astounding. That's not loading into game seeing Menu then hitting play. That's hitting play from PS5 UI to game. 2 Seconds. Insane. 

This is probably old news but had to share anyway.


From Article

We start PS5s menu screen. Before I can see to much Mike moves over to the Kena Icon selects it and presses play. Two seconds later we're in the game. That's the load Josh says perhaps sensing my astonishment. They have a whole thing set up where you can do transitions and it's very nice,but frankly it doesn't have time to play the animation he adds. It just loads the game so fast.",t2_10cf08
"It seems that playing video games early has a great positive effect onto your memory, says this neuroscience study. So ready for the PS5?","While a number of studies have shown that video games can cause structural or functional changes in the brain, including the activation of areas responsible for attention or spatial and visual skills, this new work reveals lasting beneficial effects on memory when practiced in childhood. A recent study from Neuroscience researchers of the University of Barcelona finds that playing video games during childhood improves memory sustainably.

Study is available here: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full)

This new research, was carried out by a team of researchers from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and involving 27 subjects between the ages of 18 and 40, showed that beneficial cognitive changes could occur years after giving up playing games. video games.

I game since my very young age of 6, i can confirm that my memory still works fine at 40+. 

What about you? Did you start gaming long time ago? Are you going to start with PS5? Do you think that these studies should enable governments to support gaming better? Let's maybe having a super ministry/secretary (in US) of Sport and eSport? or of Video Games? (seriously...)

The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue.,"""Fair warning. This is going to be weirder that usual.""

So hear me out. I have been paying attention to this Yakuza issue with ps4 saves not transferring to ps5 and it seems it may not be the only game having this problem and by ommission and assumptions it's gone unnoticed.

I have to think that the issue has to be a technical one. There's no way an rpg that is crossplay wouldn't want to be cross-save as well. That makes me nervous about other games like AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk that are also crossplay.

Control got heat for only allowing the Ultimate edition to upgrade, but what if they knew the older version's saves wouldn't transfer either. Also the Spider-man remaster won't allow save transfer as well. So that's three.

I am no tech guy and this may be the concerns of an overthinker, but it bares considering that saves may not be as easy to transfer from one system to the other this time.

It could explain the new crunch time situation at CDPR after they promised they wouldn't. If they hit a snag like this they would grind their way to a solution (or they just told people what they wanted to hear).",t2_1dbv0e0c

Could we see a digital trade in option in console gaming's future?,"It's not something I expect to see with this generation, but as consumers become more and more digital I fully expect in a generation or two to see consoles go the route of Digital Only.

With that in mind, I've thought about the possibility of the PS Store some time down the line offering trade ins. You buy a game at $70, and after you've decided you won't get any use out of it you have an option to delete it from your account forever for a small credit to the PS Store of like $10 or whatever.

do you think its future proof ?,"im starting to worry by seeing few posts about resolution and fps choises .

but we have to remember we, are just starting this gen and we allready have to sacrifice

resolution or frames .

down the road im starting to worry if with future more damanding games. what resolution and frame we will have .

i personally think is gonna be a struggle to keep up graphically with others platforms

that  allready started this gen with a big leap in term of performances and graphics to up to 8k.

I hope the tradition for PS4 exclusives to have incredible soundtracks carries over to the PS5,"I've only had a PS4, none of the PlayStation's before, so I'm only judging on the current gen of exclusives.

I personally think that the current gen PS exclusives have had some of, if not the best soundtracks I've ever heard in games. So I hope that the PS5 exclusives will continue having incredible soundtracks. 

Most of the time I'd say there's a couples tracks from each album that I'd listen outside of the game, but when I was making a Spotify playlist with game music. I ended up just adding pretty much all of the album. Especially Marvel's Spider-Man &amp; Detroit Become Human (I know it's not exclusive any more)

Here's some of the tracks from games that I think are incredible are warent them being some of the best.

Seems like Sony’s collaboration with AMD may have been successful,"I’ve seen quite few people speculating this in r/AMD 

[*Road to PS5 Presentation Mark Cerny says*](https://youtu.be/ph8LyNIT9sg?t=1564) - “If you see a similar discrete GPU available as a PC card at roughly the same time as we release our console, that means our collaboration with AMD succeeded.”

**Among other cards Navi 22 has been shown in a recent [leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/j06xcd/number_of_cus_of_navi_23_navi_31_van_gogh_cezanne/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) to have 40 CUs @ 2.5 GHz which is very similar to the PS5 GPU (36 CUs @ 2.23 GHz). PS5 has 90% of the CUs and 90% of the clockspeed.** 🤔

Does that mean he was likely referring to Navi 22 and the collaboration was successful? Maybe we’ll hear more in AMD’s upcoming event next month.

1440p 60fps is the way to go next gen,"Hear me out before keyboard warrioring please.

I've noticed a trend where 4K 60fps games as well as 4K 30fps games look like current gen visually(as in texture quality and the overall look of a game, not resolution). Examples of this are Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Godfall, Final Fantasy 16, Kena Bridge of spirits, Spider Man: Miles Morales and Halo Infinite. On the other hand you have very few games that genuinely look next gen. Like a handful at most. And one of these games is confirmed to run at 1440p(Demon Souls remake). Then you also have the unreal engine 5 tech demo(not a game but it still counts) which also runs at 1440p. The only other two I can think of is horizon forbidden west and black myth wukong. The former will probably be 4K 30fps knowing Sony but its going to be cross gen so a lot of power can be devoted to realistic graphics since its basically going to be an amped up version of a PS4 game. As for the latter, we do know that is 60fps and seems very unlikely to run at 4K on console judging by how advanced the graphics look compared to other next gen games. If games which look like PS4 games are bottlenecked at 4K 30 or 4K 60 there's no way in hell Black Myth Wukong can run 4K 60 so its most likely 1440p 60 like the tech demo and demon souls remake. 

Anyway, the bottom line is for a game to actually look like a genuine next gen game it has to be 1440p or sacrifice other areas like frame rate as well as being very limited in size which would be a huge turn off for some gamers such as myself who prioritise frame rate over resolution. 

1440p is a perfect compromise. 4K is a monolithic leap that is really unnecessary. Usually each gen the jump tends to be around 300p. PS1 to PS2 was 144p to 480p which is just over 300p. PS2 to PS3 was 480 to 720p which is a 240p jump. PS3 to PS4 was 720 to 1080p jump so 360p. If we go from 1080p to 1440p that would still be an above average leap at 360p difference. We all noticed the sharp resolution quality increase when we switched from 3 to 4 so why wouldn't the same happen with 1440p. 4K on the other hand is excessive. Why jump 1080 pixels all of a sudden? Not only is this uncalled for but like I said, it also sacrifices frame rate and ultimately weakens the graphical quality of games by using so much of the GPU's power so that the actual graphical quality of games look like last gen. 1440p 60fps is a much more well rounded solution that benefits everyone and is more beneficial towards both graphics and gameplay. Besides a needlessly large jump in resolution that people will get used to pretty quickly, there is nothing to lose from this.

Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013. What do you guys think how PS5 will perform throughout its life cycle?,"So this is more of a technical discussion I guess. I've been thinking a bit about the PS4 lately in an effort to understand how the PS5s life cycle may play out.

And basically three major questions have emerged:

1. was the PS4 really underpowered when it launched?

2. How come resolution and framerate didn't really get worse throughout its life cycle even as games became more visually impressive?

3. What does that mean for PS5?

I'd like to give my own two cents on this but I'm very curious to hear your takes on this since I most propably missed some stuff.

Was the PS4 underpowered? Looking back at 2013 I don't actually think it was. But the specs were certainly less impressive than PS5 today. Everyone (me included) constantly trashes PS4s CPU but at launch it was propably somewhere around Intel i3. Not too bad. The 1.84tf wasn't too bad either. Definitely not high end but still mid range. The 8gb of DDR5 on the other hand were really impressive. This was during a time when we were debating wether you needed 2gb of video RAM. All in all I'd say PS4 was a mid range system compared to PS5 which sits in the higher mid range.

So why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time? Especially during the Xbox360/PS3 era there was a clear trend towards games performing worse later in the generation. In 2006/7 you'd actually see some 720p 60fps AAA titles. Later on it was more like 540p25fps.

This didn't really happen for PS4 though and I don't really have an answer for that. At launch most PS4 games were ~900p 30fps and I can't say it has gotten much worse over time. In fact during 2015 I'd say performance actually got better with lots of games hitting 1080p30fps or 900p60fps. I don't really have an answer for this one since PS4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required years of experience to unlock its power. My guess is that games didn't get that much more demanding with PC gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals (judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example). This generation didn't really have a Crysis that completely blew away the status quo.

Now to my final question. What does that mean for PS5? While PS5 is more powerful than PS4 was back in the day I'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot.

If the life cycle does in fact turn out similarly to PS5 I think the status quo will be 4K 60fps without ray tracing and 30fps with ray tracing. However the UE5 demo from this summer tells a different story. It was super impressive but only ran at 1440p 30fps. I could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding. In that case I think it is absolutely crucial that PS5 has a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low res image to something that at least resembles 4K resolution. Otherwise I fear we will see the issue where lots of games will be ""dynamic 4K 30fps"" but will dip wayy below 4K most of the time, resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a 4K display.

What do you guys think about this? Did I miss something? Did I get something wrong? What's your take on PS4s performance throughout its life cycle and how do you anticipate PS5 will compare?",t2_5p6btf8r

Rise Gamers! Turkish Gamers are in a very bad situation. Please help us to get regional pricing,"Hi. Let me get straight to the point. I am asking for the help of all gamers around the world so Turkish Playstation users can also enjoy the great exclusives you guys do.  
  
Playstation Turkey recently increased the prices of some games to enormous amounts. For example, the new Avengers game costs 679 Turkish liras (87 US $) or Need for Speed Heat costs 709 Turkish liras (91 US $). So with these prices, we can only buy 3 games if we save all of our monthly minimum wage (2.324 Turkish liras). Let me also add that lots of people in Turkey earn a minimum wage because there is a  lack of jobs, even people who graduate from universities could end up in a minimum wage job which is not enough for anything.   
  
Let me also add that, this economical situation of our country is of course not the problem of Sony. We are also people just like you, I may or not support this goverment but I have the right to enjoy games as much as other people from other contries do. Just because I am born in this country, should not mean that I should not enjoy the things that you guys do. Other companies help with their pricing so we can also play games but Sony does not. For example 20$ indie games cost around 32 Turkish Liras on Steam so we can also enjoy them. Another example for Steam could be Cyberpunk 2077 costing 249 turkish liras. With these pricing examples, we can afford them by saving money for a few weeks/months. Microsoft also offers us Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for 45 Turkish Liras a month so we can enjoy as much as you guys do.  
  
But when it comes to Sony, they don't do anything. I also want to enjoy the new upcoming God of War Ragnarok or the new Demon's Souls but at this rate they are going to cost 800-900 turkish liras which is far from affordable. And even worse the PS5 is probably going to cost arond 8000 Turkish Liras (1020 US$) because of the heavy taxes of our country.  
  
What I am asking from Sony is to give Turkish players a regional pricing. If they don't want this because of the abuse that other gamers from other countries can do (buying from us because its cheaper) they could make it so that only people with Turkish ID's would be able to buy from the Turkish store.  
  
And from you guys and girls, from you fellow Gamers. I am asking for your support. Please support us so we can also enjoy that new God of War game, even that cute Bugsnax game together. I don't want to be forced to wait for the hope of getting these new games on ps plus when they come to that service 4 years later. I just want to enjoy these games together with my fellow gamers around the world.",t2_di948

Game boost mode for ps4 games,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

He was not talking about BC but Game boost mode for ps4 titles. 

That's a huge fucking announcement that got obscured due to not understanding what he was talking about at the time due to missing info.

I understand that they wouldn't want to, but I'm not sure if it was possible, that as the games they make get more demanding and as they try to squeeze every last bit out of the system to make what they are trying to achieve, that the SSD can't keep up to the point we get back to longer load times again.

Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is. I just think that this huge boost in speed will open the door to much more amazing and beautiful looking first party games with even bigger worlds and even more detailed environments than previously imagined for next generation.",t2_tlwzh7f

PS5 checkerboard rendering?,"With Digital Foundry's recent analysis of Demons Souls indicating a 1440p/60fps rendering target, it occurred to me that I don't recall hearing (and haven't been able to uncover) anything about a native checkerboarding solution for PS5. For those unaware, the PS4 Pro had dedicated hardware to interpolate and fill in missing pixels from incomplete 4K frames using previous frames (aka ""checkerboard rendering""), giving a much better visual approximation of 4K than upscaling, but without the performance cost of native 4K.

It seemed logical that Demon's Souls could *possibly* target a CB4k/60fps display if Sony has included similar checkerboarding hardware in the PS5. A partial 1920x2160 frame (whose missing 1920 horizontal pixels could be CB'ed to complete a full 4K frame) does contain 12% more pixels than a native 1440p one (4,147,200 pixels vs 3,686,400), but that does put it at least potentially within optimization reach for Demon's Souls. I would consider this somewhat unlikely for Demon's, given that Bluepoint is on record as preferring the simpler approach of temporal injection of 1440p into a 4K framebuffer in the Shadow of the Colossus remaster. Regardless, having the option of checkerboarding on the PS5 could put higher-detail performance modes within reach of many future titles, rather than forcing a strict compromise of ""performance = 1440p, detail = 4K"".

I can see why Sony might not have drawn attention to checkerboarding with the PS5, as it would likely stoke fanboy allegations of the console being too weak for ""real 4K"" etc, but given how well it was implemented in the PS4 Pro, it's hard for me to imagine them excluding it for any reason other than the already high expense of the hardware. I know there are robust software-based checkerboarding solutions out there, and 1440p titles from last-gen like Uncharted 4 / LL and TLoU2 did really well with their overall image quality and detail. But for me the PS4 Pro really proved that checkerboarding is the best technology outside of DLSS for getting high detail at a low performance cost, and if a game could offer me CB4K/60fps vs 1440p/60fps, I'd choose the former almost every time.",t2_l34q1c0

3. Spider-Man that comes with Miles Morales is a Remaster and this is completely different than increasing few settings in a options menu. This remaster includes ray tracing, new assets, increased city density and it took many developers time and effort. 

4. PS4 controller DualShock 4 is only able to play PS4 games on PS5. The reason why we are not able to play PS5 only games with DualShock 4 is that the PS5 only games are designed to fully utilise the DualSense controller that includes gameplay functions.",t2_13cvoc

Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I’ve ever had. And here are my tips if you ever decide to camp out for one.,"As the title says, I’ve managed to secure a pre order at my GameStop to get my PS5, and I still can’t believe it honestly. Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it’s been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they’ll have available, if it’s okay to start a line overnight, what they’re store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don’t show up at 6AM thinking that you’re going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5’s available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don’t have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don’t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It’s going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what’s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other’s backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You’re all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who’s unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don’t be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it’ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who’s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that’s awesome, but if you don’t just make sure you don’t take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I’ll say this, I wasn’t going to go either, but something just told me “fuck it, if there aren’t any then just go back home”, but I’m telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you’ll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren’t able to secure a PS5, eventually you won’t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don’t lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can’t believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you’re local weather! Bring completely charged electronics &amp; of course wear your masks!",t2_6cu42drr
PS5 should let you set Home Screen music,"You know how you get the game soundtrack for certain digital deluxe games like The Last of us 2 and Ghost of Tsushima?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What we don’t do so much in is multiplayer.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;But, no, I was referencing more with the things like “GTA 5 Online,” or you look at “Call of Duty,” or “Fortnite,” or any of those experiences. Worldwide Studios, like I say, we’ve been going really heavy into story-driven gaming. The power of the narrative. Big, spectacular experiences. But not a whole lot in the multiplayer side of things,  
&gt;  
&gt;**I think that’s an area where you will likely see us start to make more noise in the new term**.

Sony haven't seriously dabbled in the MP scenery, I mean yeah we had Killzone Shadow Fall, Driveclub but they were quickly forgotten.

What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5,"Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.


&amp;nbsp;

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",t2_civ38

Would it make sense to buy the game at launch for PS4, and then loan it to my little bro to play. And then when the PS5 upgrade comes about, start playing it myself then? Would that work? Do I need to be careful about registering to my account first or something?

"Nippon Marathon 2 Is Apparently Getting a Kickstarter (29th on) (I'm unrelated, just a fan)","So while everyone is playing Fall Guys, I have been playing for the last year or so+, Nippon Marathon, it's honestly Fall Guys on crack (but came a lot earlier), being like this weird japanese game show but reality thing where there is a humanoid dog in a shirt and scarf battling an old japanese man in a school girl outfit, etc. I really liked it, and I had found out that there is going to be a kickstarter for this game on the 29th, and it's apparently getting physical (which implies console release, and they even kind of point out that in the info), and like, I'm so damn ready for this beautiful jank mess of a game to hopefully get a sequel.

First game:

Idk, seemed worth mentioning, I probably plan on supporting the kickstarter, and I'm pretty excited after finding out about it post playing on it (on pc) with my friend (remote play anywhere, ie we social distanced)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else a fan of the first one? I for one am excited for a sequel, though I hope they don't try to jack of the graphics above their talents, and it hurts the game itself (like trine 3, rip)

I hope PS5 will allow us to do this.(regarding save scumming),"on PS4 if you want to back up a save to USB you have to close the game to do the back up task, that's really irritating especially when you go after 2 or more conflicting Trophies (i.e. Endings) or when forging an equipment which have RNG skills and you are looking for a specific skill on that equipment until you're running out of resources if you didn't get what you want you can go to your backed up save. i know PS5 can boot up games fast and i'll be where i left the game in few seconds after backing up my save but still doing that without shutting down the game is more convenient for us Save-Scummers.
Sorry for any grammar mistake, English isn't my mother tongue.

TL;DR i hope PS5 allows us to back up saves to USB while the game is still running.",t2_11qhec

Who here is refugee from geforce now?,"After using gfn for nearly 3 years and having virtually all of my favourite games removed from the service - I am coming to ps5 so I have more actual ownership of my games.

Gfn plays perfectly well and gives reasonable graphics at 1080p, but it's not without its faults. Small amounts of lag, sub par rigs for certain games - these are all problems I am looking to overcome with getting a ps5.

Sony should capitalize on gyro-aiming this generation.,"Gyro aiming is a way of minimizing the precision gap between controllers versus mouse&amp;keyboard. The use of gyro aiming doesn't replace the the right analog stick, but instead is used merely for fine-tuning. For those unfamiliar, here are a few videos illustrating in different ways its surprising potential for shooter games:

————

[\[Halo with gyro aiming\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqaz6SxnwnI&amp;t=1s)

[\[Linus Tech Tips\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qlZmXnE1mw)

[\[Motion Controls and the Rejection of Progress\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=binPB4YbWmM&amp;ab_channel=Nerrel)

————

 Unfortunately, gyro aiming is often misunderstood. Here are common arguments I see against it, and why they aren't compelling:

**I wouldn't use it.** That's fine. But others would like to, and making it optional can leave everyone happy.

**It shouldn't be mandatory.** To my knowledge, no shooter has ever made gyro aiming mandatory.

**It would be expensive.** Gyro sensors are relatively inexpensive and wouldn't require any novel technology.

**It hinders accessibility.** More options increases accessibility.

**It's a gimmick.** Gyro aiming requires minimal movement and provides enhanced precision, unlike certain previous implementations of motion controls that have rightly been regarded as gimmicky.

**Not enough people care about it.** That's quickly changing as more and more people come to realize its potential.

————

On the other hand, there are good arguments in favor of gyro aiming. Most importantly, joysticks are intrinsically limited for aiming; gyro aiming enables a finer degree of precision. This

* fine-tunes the controls.
* enhances player agency.
* raises the skill ceiling without necessarily raising the skill floor.
* reduces the need to rely on auto-aim as a crutch.

————

One of the significant but underappreciated differences between the PS5 and XBX is that the PS5's controller enables gyro-aiming while the XBX's controller does not. However, there's been little effort by Sony to capitalize on this advantage. This is nothing new—the PS4 controller has a gyro sensor, but gyro aiming often wasn't even implemented in PS4's first-person shooters. This strikes me as a missed opportunity.

If you agree, I suggest reaching out to Sony via social media. The technology is already there—it's just up to Sony to take advantage of it.",t2_gxwjj

(Unpopular Opinion?) There is absolutely not a lack of content or information coming from Sony,"First let me say that I've enjoyed hanging out on this subreddit during the build up to PS5 and I've seen some really great posts on here, in fact I changed from a long time lurker to poster because of this sub!

I must say however that recently (especially the last week), I've seen several people commenting that there's nothing coming from Sony and they're getting frustrated with the lack of info.

I'm not sure if its because I'm an older gamer (started on snes for reference lol) but this comes across as such impatience to me when I see it. Am I the only one still riding the hype from the showcase that was exactly 2 weeks ago? 

Not to mention the continuous blog posts giving more tid bits. Sure they've not shown the UI but what they have shown me is great looking games that I cant wait to play.

And you know what? I had no idea what the UI on any console I've ever owned would look like before I switched it on and I honestly think it adds to the wonder of using your shiny new console for the very first time. Surpises can be great!

Help me understand Ray Tracing (Spider-Man PS4 remastered) Honest question.," I'm not a pc gamer, so I'm not used to Ray Tracing. 

So from what I heard and know, Ray Tracing allow light to better reflects on surface and to create better reflection. (I can be wrong) 

And as you all know, today this photo of Spider-Man Ps4 remastered came to life. 

[https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv](https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv)

But I feel like there's something wrong.

With how high Peter is and that camera angle, is that normal to see all the street and the pedestrians below him? 

And also is Ray Tracing supposed to be ""like a mirror""? I mean is it supposed to have a 100% reflection of what is on the other side/angle? Is it too exaggerated in the photo or is this really what is Ray Tracing?

All good things come to those people who wait,"Hello 

I hope you are having a safe journey through 2020. I have seen many posts regarding PlayStation’s silence and wanted to add something to the discussion. So here it goes: 

One thing I know from Sony and PlayStation’s marketing team is they are Marketing Gods amongst men. They know that selling something when it’s sold out is not the best idea. 

There is even a study from University of Alberta and according to them 

“An empty store shelf tempts shoppers to buy the next best thing” 

This means if they start advertising without any stock they might end up selling more of their competitors products. 

In addition, in my opinion PS5’s 

The Load times are better 

The controller is better 

The launch games are better 

The first year games are better 

The third party support is better

Backwards compatible first party games are better 

The UI is better (subjective) 

Also just saying combined with the two IO co processors the CPU is going to be better 

In addition with the cache scrubbers and the higher clock speed on the GPU is going to run better 

All in all just wait all good things will come to those who wait. Only 6 weeks to go.

Anyone else dislike the subscription model for games?,"Maybe I’m in the minority here but I feel there isn’t enough discussion about this. 

I’m not a big fan of the Netflix-like subscription model for games. 
I was really excited to try out services like PS Now/Game pass, but unfortunately I never touched 90% of the mediocre games they offer in the library. 

Maybe it’s just me or how I treat video games as a form of entertainment. 
It’s not like watching an average popcorn flick on Netflix and have a good time. 
I just can’t invest my time in a mediocre game and have fun. There’s nothing worse than playing a bad game. 

There are some occasional big games added to the library and majority of the users seem to be waiting only for those. And this seriously raises doubts about the value for money aspect with these subscription models. 

I really love the monthly free games offered on PlayStation Plus because for most months, they do give decent games. But this subscription model just doesn’t seem to click with me.",t2_zm0ecm7

First-Party Titles Run At 4K@30 or Dynamic 4K@60?,"So on the Spider-Man Remastered page, it says, [Link](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered/);

&gt;Experience the critically acclaimed hit with updated graphical assets and in stunning dynamic 4K/HDR\*. And experience swinging through New York and combat as an experienced Spider-Man with an optional performance mode that takes advantage of Insomniac’s temporal injection for dynamic 4K/60fps\*.

We have also been told that;

&gt;and the same optional performance mode offered on Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, allowing you to finally play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate.

We also know that Demon's Souls, at least in the trailer, according to DF was rendering internally at 1440p and then upscaled to 4K so basically Dynamic 4K right?

Does this mean that in quality mode the games will run at 4K@30fps with ray-tracing and in performance mode, it will run in Dynamic 4K@60fps without downgrading graphical fidelity so raytracing still on?

Even if it is up to the dev, it seems that Miles Morales, Spider-Man Remastered, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Demon's Souls will have these 2 choices, they seem to be using Insomniac's Temporal Injection method,

&gt;which takes a lower internal resolution and uses prior/upcoming frames as well as AA to fill in the details to get a 4K image. It's another way of upscaling, like checkerboarding is, but temporal injection gives a cleaner image. Before DLSS 2.0 it was probably the best quality upscaling method.

I think PlayStation is letting Microsoft have the spotlight right now because once demonstrations of PS5 UI and loading into games happen it's going to drop jaws how fast PS5 really is.,"I'm sure you've heard how fast PS5 is Multiple times but reading the latest Gameinformer it blew me away.

He said the game loaded from PS5 Menu to gameplay in 2 Seconds. That's astounding. That's not loading into game seeing Menu then hitting play. That's hitting play from PS5 UI to game. 2 Seconds. Insane. 

This is probably old news but had to share anyway.


From Article

We start PS5s menu screen. Before I can see to much Mike moves over to the Kena Icon selects it and presses play. Two seconds later we're in the game. That's the load Josh says perhaps sensing my astonishment.

"It seems that playing video games early has a great positive effect onto your memory, says this neuroscience study. So ready for the PS5?","While a number of studies have shown that video games can cause structural or functional changes in the brain, including the activation of areas responsible for attention or spatial and visual skills, this new work reveals lasting beneficial effects on memory when practiced in childhood. A recent study from Neuroscience researchers of the University of Barcelona finds that playing video games during childhood improves memory sustainably.

Study is available here: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full)

This new research, was carried out by a team of researchers from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and involving 27 subjects between the ages of 18 and 40, showed that beneficial cognitive changes could occur years after giving up playing games. video games.

I game since my very young age of 6, i can confirm that my memory still works fine at 40+. 

What about you? Did you start gaming long time ago? Are you going to start with PS5? Do you think that these studies should enable governments to support gaming better? Let's maybe having a super ministry/secretary (in US) of Sport and eSport? or of Video Games? (seriously...)

The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue.,"""Fair warning. This is going to be weirder that usual.""

So hear me out. I have been paying attention to this Yakuza issue with ps4 saves not transferring to ps5 and it seems it may not be the only game having this problem and by ommission and assumptions it's gone unnoticed.

I have to think that the issue has to be a technical one. There's no way an rpg that is crossplay wouldn't want to be cross-save as well. That makes me nervous about other games like AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk that are also crossplay.

Control got heat for only allowing the Ultimate edition to upgrade, but what if they knew the older version's saves wouldn't transfer either. Also the Spider-man remaster won't allow save transfer as well. So that's three.

I am no tech guy and this may be the concerns of an overthinker, but it bares considering that saves may not be as easy to transfer from one system to the other this time.

It could explain the new crunch time situation at CDPR after they promised they wouldn't. If they hit a snag like this they would grind their way to a solution (or they just told people what they wanted to hear).",t2_1dbv0e0c

I keep seeing Demon’s Souls and Miles Morales but Sackboy and Destruction All-Stars gets no love, I have a feeling that Destruction All-Stars is going to be a sleeper hit and Sackboy: A Big Adventure is also refreshing especially since LittleBigPlanet is my favorite PS3 game of all time. Anyways, thank God for this amazing lineup, and good luck to those who are still looking for a console!",t2_6cu42drr

Could we see a digital trade in option in console gaming's future?,"It's not something I expect to see with this generation, but as consumers become more and more digital I fully expect in a generation or two to see consoles go the route of Digital Only.

With that in mind, I've thought about the possibility of the PS Store some time down the line offering trade ins. You buy a game at $70, and after you've decided you won't get any use out of it you have an option to delete it from your account forever for a small credit to the PS Store of like $10 or whatever. I think it could give incentive for players to spend more money with PS over the long term if they took this approach.

I hope the tradition for PS4 exclusives to have incredible soundtracks carries over to the PS5,"I've only had a PS4, none of the PlayStation's before, so I'm only judging on the current gen of exclusives.

I personally think that the current gen PS exclusives have had some of, if not the best soundtracks I've ever heard in games. So I hope that the PS5 exclusives will continue having incredible soundtracks. 

Most of the time I'd say there's a couples tracks from each album that I'd listen outside of the game, but when I was making a Spotify playlist with game music. I ended up just adding pretty much all of the album. Especially Marvel's Spider-Man &amp; Detroit Become Human (I know it's not exclusive any more)

Seems like Sony’s collaboration with AMD may have been successful,"I’ve seen quite few people speculating this in r/AMD 

[*Road to PS5 Presentation Mark Cerny says*](https://youtu.be/ph8LyNIT9sg?t=1564) - “If you see a similar discrete GPU available as a PC card at roughly the same time as we release our console, that means our collaboration with AMD succeeded.”

**Among other cards Navi 22 has been shown in a recent [leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/j06xcd/number_of_cus_of_navi_23_navi_31_van_gogh_cezanne/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) to have 40 CUs @ 2.5 GHz which is very similar to the PS5 GPU (36 CUs @ 2.23 GHz). PS5 has 90% of the CUs and 90% of the clockspeed.** 🤔

1440p 60fps is the way to go next gen,"Hear me out before keyboard warrioring please.

I've noticed a trend where 4K 60fps games as well as 4K 30fps games look like current gen visually(as in texture quality and the overall look of a game, not resolution). Examples of this are Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Godfall, Final Fantasy 16, Kena Bridge of spirits, Spider Man: Miles Morales and Halo Infinite. On the other hand you have very few games that genuinely look next gen. Like a handful at most. And one of these games is confirmed to run at 1440p(Demon Souls remake). Then you also have the unreal engine 5 tech demo(not a game but it still counts) which also runs at 1440p. The only other two I can think of is horizon forbidden west and black myth wukong. The former will probably be 4K 30fps knowing Sony but its going to be cross gen so a lot of power can be devoted to realistic graphics since its basically going to be an amped up version of a PS4 game. As for the latter, we do know that is 60fps and seems very unlikely to run at 4K on console judging by how advanced the graphics look compared to other next gen games. If games which look like PS4 games are bottlenecked at 4K 30 or 4K 60 there's no way in hell Black Myth Wukong can run 4K 60 so its most likely 1440p 60 like the tech demo and demon souls remake. 

Anyway, the bottom line is for a game to actually look like a genuine next gen game it has to be 1440p or sacrifice other areas like frame rate as well as being very limited in size which would be a huge turn off for some gamers such as myself who prioritise frame rate over resolution. 

1440p is a perfect compromise. 4K is a monolithic leap that is really unnecessary. Usually each gen the jump tends to be around 300p. PS1 to PS2 was 144p to 480p which is just over 300p. PS2 to PS3 was 480 to 720p which is a 240p jump. PS3 to PS4 was 720 to 1080p jump so 360p. If we go from 1080p to 1440p that would still be an above average leap at 360p difference. We all noticed the sharp resolution quality increase when we switched from 3 to 4 so why wouldn't the same happen with 1440p. 4K on the other hand is excessive. Why jump 1080 pixels all of a sudden? Not only is this uncalled for but like I said, it also sacrifices frame rate and ultimately weakens the graphical quality of games by using so much of the GPU's power so that the actual graphical quality of games look like last gen. 1440p 60fps is a much more well rounded solution that benefits everyone and is more beneficial towards both graphics and gameplay. Besides a needlessly large jump in resolution that people will get used to pretty quickly, there is nothing to lose from this.

Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013. What do you guys think how PS5 will perform throughout its life cycle?,"So this is more of a technical discussion I guess. I've been thinking a bit about the PS4 lately in an effort to understand how the PS5s life cycle may play out.

And basically three major questions have emerged:

1. was the PS4 really underpowered when it launched?

2. How come resolution and framerate didn't really get worse throughout its life cycle even as games became more visually impressive?

3. What does that mean for PS5?

I'd like to give my own two cents on this but I'm very curious to hear your takes on this since I most propably missed some stuff.

Was the PS4 underpowered? Looking back at 2013 I don't actually think it was. But the specs were certainly less impressive than PS5 today. Everyone (me included) constantly trashes PS4s CPU but at launch it was propably somewhere around Intel i3. Not too bad. The 1.84tf wasn't too bad either. Definitely not high end but still mid range. The 8gb of DDR5 on the other hand were really impressive. This was during a time when we were debating wether you needed 2gb of video RAM. All in all I'd say PS4 was a mid range system compared to PS5 which sits in the higher mid range.

So why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time? Especially during the Xbox360/PS3 era there was a clear trend towards games performing worse later in the generation. In 2006/7 you'd actually see some 720p 60fps AAA titles. Later on it was more like 540p25fps.

This didn't really happen for PS4 though and I don't really have an answer for that. At launch most PS4 games were ~900p 30fps and I can't say it has gotten much worse over time. In fact during 2015 I'd say performance actually got better with lots of games hitting 1080p30fps or 900p60fps. I don't really have an answer for this one since PS4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required years of experience to unlock its power. My guess is that games didn't get that much more demanding with PC gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals (judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example). This generation didn't really have a Crysis that completely blew away the status quo.

Now to my final question. What does that mean for PS5? While PS5 is more powerful than PS4 was back in the day I'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot.

If the life cycle does in fact turn out similarly to PS5 I think the status quo will be 4K 60fps without ray tracing and 30fps with ray tracing. However the UE5 demo from this summer tells a different story. It was super impressive but only ran at 1440p 30fps. I could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding. In that case I think it is absolutely crucial that PS5 has a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low res image to something that at least resembles 4K resolution. Otherwise I fear we will see the issue where lots of games will be ""dynamic 4K 30fps"" but will dip wayy below 4K most of the time, resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a 4K display.

What do you guys think about this? Did I miss something? Did I get something wrong? What's your take on PS4s performance throughout its life cycle and how do you anticipate PS5 will compare?",t2_5p6btf8r

Rise Gamers! Turkish Gamers are in a very bad situation. Please help us to get regional pricing,"Hi. Let me get straight to the point. I am asking for the help of all gamers around the world so Turkish Playstation users can also enjoy the great exclusives you guys do.  
  
Playstation Turkey recently increased the prices of some games to enormous amounts. For example, the new Avengers game costs 679 Turkish liras (87 US $) or Need for Speed Heat costs 709 Turkish liras (91 US $). So with these prices, we can only buy 3 games if we save all of our monthly minimum wage (2.324 Turkish liras). Let me also add that lots of people in Turkey earn a minimum wage because there is a  lack of jobs, even people who graduate from universities could end up in a minimum wage job which is not enough for anything.   
  
Let me also add that, this economical situation of our country is of course not the problem of Sony. We are also people just like you, I may or not support this goverment but I have the right to enjoy games as much as other people from other contries do. Just because I am born in this country, should not mean that I should not enjoy the things that you guys do. Other companies help with their pricing so we can also play games but Sony does not. For example 20$ indie games cost around 32 Turkish Liras on Steam so we can also enjoy them. Another example for Steam could be Cyberpunk 2077 costing 249 turkish liras. With these pricing examples, we can afford them by saving money for a few weeks/months. Microsoft also offers us Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for 45 Turkish Liras a month so we can enjoy as much as you guys do.  
  
But when it comes to Sony, they don't do anything. I also want to enjoy the new upcoming God of War Ragnarok or the new Demon's Souls but at this rate they are going to cost 800-900 turkish liras which is far from affordable. And even worse the PS5 is probably going to cost arond 8000 Turkish Liras (1020 US$) because of the heavy taxes of our country.  
  
What I am asking from Sony is to give Turkish players a regional pricing. If they don't want this because of the abuse that other gamers from other countries can do (buying from us because its cheaper) they could make it so that only people with Turkish ID's would be able to buy from the Turkish store.

Game boost mode for ps4 games,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

He was not talking about BC but Game boost mode for ps4 titles. 

That's a huge fucking announcement that got obscured due to not understanding what he was talking about at the time due to missing info.

PS concerning the flair, I don't really think this is specualtion but more of a realization and confirmation that most didn't pick up on yet.",t2_oyx1u

A lot of talk about the SSD recently,"The SSD, I know for launch games it will load games almost instantly but I'm wondering down the line, when we get to the back end of the generation will developers be able to eat up this quick load time to the point we experience load times as they are now or is this not possible? 

I understand that they wouldn't want to, but I'm not sure if it was possible, that as the games they make get more demanding and as they try to squeeze every last bit out of the system to make what they are trying to achieve, that the SSD can't keep up to the point we get back to longer load times again. I only say this because it's like on any new system, it starts out fast but as time goes on it starts to get slower to the point where menus are a bit more laggy etc.",t2_zh5di

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling. Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is. I just think that this huge boost in speed will open the door to much more amazing and beautiful looking first party games with even bigger worlds and even more detailed environments than previously imagined for next generation.",t2_tlwzh7f

PS5 checkerboard rendering?,"With Digital Foundry's recent analysis of Demons Souls indicating a 1440p/60fps rendering target, it occurred to me that I don't recall hearing (and haven't been able to uncover) anything about a native checkerboarding solution for PS5. For those unaware, the PS4 Pro had dedicated hardware to interpolate and fill in missing pixels from incomplete 4K frames using previous frames (aka ""checkerboard rendering""), giving a much better visual approximation of 4K than upscaling, but without the performance cost of native 4K.

It seemed logical that Demon's Souls could *possibly* target a CB4k/60fps display if Sony has included similar checkerboarding hardware in the PS5. A partial 1920x2160 frame (whose missing 1920 horizontal pixels could be CB'ed to complete a full 4K frame) does contain 12% more pixels than a native 1440p one (4,147,200 pixels vs 3,686,400), but that does put it at least potentially within optimization reach for Demon's Souls. I would consider this somewhat unlikely for Demon's, given that Bluepoint is on record as preferring the simpler approach of temporal injection of 1440p into a 4K framebuffer in the Shadow of the Colossus remaster. Regardless, having the option of checkerboarding on the PS5 could put higher-detail performance modes within reach of many future titles, rather than forcing a strict compromise of ""performance = 1440p, detail = 4K"".

I can see why Sony might not have drawn attention to checkerboarding with the PS5, as it would likely stoke fanboy allegations of the console being too weak for ""real 4K"" etc, but given how well it was implemented in the PS4 Pro, it's hard for me to imagine them excluding it for any reason other than the already high expense of the hardware. I know there are robust software-based checkerboarding solutions out there, and 1440p titles from last-gen like Uncharted 4 / LL and TLoU2 did really well with their overall image quality and detail. But for me the PS4 Pro really proved that checkerboarding is the best technology outside of DLSS for getting high detail at a low performance cost, and if a game could offer me CB4K/60fps vs 1440p/60fps, I'd choose the former almost every time.",t2_l34q1c0

3. Spider-Man that comes with Miles Morales is a Remaster and this is completely different than increasing few settings in a options menu. This remaster includes ray tracing, new assets, increased city density and it took many developers time and effort. 

4. PS4 controller DualShock 4 is only able to play PS4 games on PS5. The reason why we are not able to play PS5 only games with DualShock 4 is that the PS5 only games are designed to fully utilise the DualSense controller that includes gameplay functions.",t2_13cvoc

Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I’ve ever had. And here are my tips if you ever decide to camp out for one.,"As the title says, I’ve managed to secure a pre order at my GameStop to get my PS5, and I still can’t believe it honestly. Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it’s been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they’ll have available, if it’s okay to start a line overnight, what they’re store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don’t show up at 6AM thinking that you’re going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5’s available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don’t have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don’t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It’s going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what’s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other’s backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You’re all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who’s unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don’t be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it’ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who’s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that’s awesome, but if you don’t just make sure you don’t take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I’ll say this, I wasn’t going to go either, but something just told me “fuck it, if there aren’t any then just go back home”, but I’m telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you’ll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren’t able to secure a PS5, eventually you won’t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don’t lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can’t believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you’re local weather! Bring completely charged electronics &amp; of course wear your masks!",t2_6cu42drr

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What we don’t do so much in is multiplayer.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;But, no, I was referencing more with the things like “GTA 5 Online,” or you look at “Call of Duty,” or “Fortnite,” or any of those experiences.

What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5,"Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",t2_civ38

Would it make sense to buy the game at launch for PS4, and then loan it to my little bro to play. And then when the PS5 upgrade comes about, start playing it myself then? Would that work? Do I need to be careful about registering to my account first or something?

I hope PS5 will allow us to do this.(regarding save scumming),"on PS4 if you want to back up a save to USB you have to close the game to do the back up task, that's really irritating especially when you go after 2 or more conflicting Trophies (i.e. Endings) or when forging an equipment which have RNG skills and you are looking for a specific skill on that equipment until you're running out of resources if you didn't get what you want you can go to your backed up save. i know PS5 can boot up games fast and i'll be where i left the game in few seconds after backing up my save but still doing that without shutting down the game is more convenient for us Save-Scummers.
Sorry for any grammar mistake, English isn't my mother tongue.

Gfn plays perfectly well and gives reasonable graphics at 1080p, but it's not without its faults. Small amounts of lag, sub par rigs for certain games - these are all problems I am looking to overcome with getting a ps5.

**Title Guidelines**

* Clickbait, editorialized, sensationalized, misleading titles, or attempting to draw attention to the post.
* Vague, generalised, unclear titles. Titles must describe the content of the post.
* Post about a specific game must include the name of the game in the title.

If all goes well, we might continue this but for now, let's give it a test run. We want to see how this impacts the sub before we decide to move forward with how media posting is handled here.

Sony should capitalize on gyro-aiming this generation.,"Gyro aiming is a way of minimizing the precision gap between controllers versus mouse&amp;keyboard. The use of gyro aiming doesn't replace the the right analog stick, but instead is used merely for fine-tuning. For those unfamiliar, here are a few videos illustrating in different ways its surprising potential for shooter games:

————

[\[Halo with gyro aiming\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqaz6SxnwnI&amp;t=1s)

[\[Linus Tech Tips\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qlZmXnE1mw)

[\[Motion Controls and the Rejection of Progress\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=binPB4YbWmM&amp;ab_channel=Nerrel)

————

 Unfortunately, gyro aiming is often misunderstood. Here are common arguments I see against it, and why they aren't compelling:

**I wouldn't use it.** That's fine. But others would like to, and making it optional can leave everyone happy.

**It shouldn't be mandatory.** To my knowledge, no shooter has ever made gyro aiming mandatory.

**It would be expensive.** Gyro sensors are relatively inexpensive and wouldn't require any novel technology.

**It hinders accessibility.** More options increases accessibility.

**It's a gimmick.** Gyro aiming requires minimal movement and provides enhanced precision, unlike certain previous implementations of motion controls that have rightly been regarded as gimmicky.

**Not enough people care about it.** That's quickly changing as more and more people come to realize its potential.

————

On the other hand, there are good arguments in favor of gyro aiming. Most importantly, joysticks are intrinsically limited for aiming; gyro aiming enables a finer degree of precision. This

* fine-tunes the controls.
* enhances player agency.
* raises the skill ceiling without necessarily raising the skill floor.
* reduces the need to rely on auto-aim as a crutch.

————

One of the significant but underappreciated differences between the PS5 and XBX is that the PS5's controller enables gyro-aiming while the XBX's controller does not. However, there's been little effort by Sony to capitalize on this advantage. This is nothing new—the PS4 controller has a gyro sensor, but gyro aiming often wasn't even implemented in PS4's first-person shooters. This strikes me as a missed opportunity.

If you agree, I suggest reaching out to Sony via social media. The technology is already there—it's just up to Sony to take advantage of it.",t2_gxwjj

(Unpopular Opinion?) There is absolutely not a lack of content or information coming from Sony,"First let me say that I've enjoyed hanging out on this subreddit during the build up to PS5 and I've seen some really great posts on here, in fact I changed from a long time lurker to poster because of this sub!

I must say however that recently (especially the last week), I've seen several people commenting that there's nothing coming from Sony and they're getting frustrated with the lack of info.

I'm not sure if its because I'm an older gamer (started on snes for reference lol) but this comes across as such impatience to me when I see it. Am I the only one still riding the hype from the showcase that was exactly 2 weeks ago? 

Not to mention the continuous blog posts giving more tid bits. Sure they've not shown the UI but what they have shown me is great looking games that I cant wait to play.

And you know what? I had no idea what the UI on any console I've ever owned would look like before I switched it on and I honestly think it adds to the wonder of using your shiny new console for the very first time. Surpises can be great!

Help me understand Ray Tracing (Spider-Man PS4 remastered) Honest question.," I'm not a pc gamer, so I'm not used to Ray Tracing. 

So from what I heard and know, Ray Tracing allow light to better reflects on surface and to create better reflection. (I can be wrong) 

And as you all know, today this photo of Spider-Man Ps4 remastered came to life. 

[https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv](https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv)

But I feel like there's something wrong.

With how high Peter is and that camera angle, is that normal to see all the street and the pedestrians below him? 

And also is Ray Tracing supposed to be ""like a mirror""? I mean is it supposed to have a 100% reflection of what is on the other side/angle? Is it too exaggerated in the photo or is this really what is Ray Tracing? 

I feel like this is just because it's the beggining of it on consoles so Devs doesn't have a standpoint (except on Pc)

All good things come to those people who wait,"Hello 

I hope you are having a safe journey through 2020. I have seen many posts regarding PlayStation’s silence and wanted to add something to the discussion. So here it goes: 

One thing I know from Sony and PlayStation’s marketing team is they are Marketing Gods amongst men. They know that selling something when it’s sold out is not the best idea. 

There is even a study from University of Alberta and according to them 

“An empty store shelf tempts shoppers to buy the next best thing” 

This means if they start advertising without any stock they might end up selling more of their competitors products. 

In addition, in my opinion PS5’s 

The Load times are better 

The controller is better 

The launch games are better 

The first year games are better 

The third party support is better

Backwards compatible first party games are better 

The UI is better (subjective) 

Also just saying combined with the two IO co processors the CPU is going to be better 

In addition with the cache scrubbers and the higher clock speed on the GPU is going to run better 

All in all just wait all good things will come to those who wait. Only 6 weeks to go.

Anyone else dislike the subscription model for games?,"Maybe I’m in the minority here but I feel there isn’t enough discussion about this. 

I’m not a big fan of the Netflix-like subscription model for games. 
I was really excited to try out services like PS Now/Game pass, but unfortunately I never touched 90% of the mediocre games they offer in the library. 

Maybe it’s just me or how I treat video games as a form of entertainment. 
It’s not like watching an average popcorn flick on Netflix and have a good time. 
I just can’t invest my time in a mediocre game and have fun. There’s nothing worse than playing a bad game. 

There are some occasional big games added to the library and majority of the users seem to be waiting only for those. And this seriously raises doubts about the value for money aspect with these subscription models.

First-Party Titles Run At 4K@30 or Dynamic 4K@60?,"So on the Spider-Man Remastered page, it says, [Link](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered/);

&gt;Experience the critically acclaimed hit with updated graphical assets and in stunning dynamic 4K/HDR\*. And experience swinging through New York and combat as an experienced Spider-Man with an optional performance mode that takes advantage of Insomniac’s temporal injection for dynamic 4K/60fps\*.

We have also been told that;

&gt;and the same optional performance mode offered on Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, allowing you to finally play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate.

We also know that Demon's Souls, at least in the trailer, according to DF was rendering internally at 1440p and then upscaled to 4K so basically Dynamic 4K right?

Does this mean that in quality mode the games will run at 4K@30fps with ray-tracing and in performance mode, it will run in Dynamic 4K@60fps without downgrading graphical fidelity so raytracing still on?

Even if it is up to the dev, it seems that Miles Morales, Spider-Man Remastered, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Demon's Souls will have these 2 choices, they seem to be using Insomniac's Temporal Injection method,

&gt;which takes a lower internal resolution and uses prior/upcoming frames as well as AA to fill in the details to get a 4K image. It's another way of upscaling, like checkerboarding is, but temporal injection gives a cleaner image. Before DLSS 2.0 it was probably the best quality upscaling method.

He said the game loaded from PS5 Menu to gameplay in 2 Seconds. That's astounding. That's not loading into game seeing Menu then hitting play. That's hitting play from PS5 UI to game. 2 Seconds. Insane. 

This is probably old news but had to share anyway.


From Article

We start PS5s menu screen. Before I can see to much Mike moves over to the Kena Icon selects it and presses play. Two seconds later we're in the game. That's the load Josh says perhaps sensing my astonishment. They have a whole thing set up where you can do transitions and it's very nice,but frankly it doesn't have time to play the animation he adds. It just loads the game so fast.",t2_10cf08
"It seems that playing video games early has a great positive effect onto your memory, says this neuroscience study. So ready for the PS5?","While a number of studies have shown that video games can cause structural or functional changes in the brain, including the activation of areas responsible for attention or spatial and visual skills, this new work reveals lasting beneficial effects on memory when practiced in childhood. A recent study from Neuroscience researchers of the University of Barcelona finds that playing video games during childhood improves memory sustainably.

Study is available here: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full)

This new research, was carried out by a team of researchers from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and involving 27 subjects between the ages of 18 and 40, showed that beneficial cognitive changes could occur years after giving up playing games. video games.

I game since my very young age of 6, i can confirm that my memory still works fine at 40+.

The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue.,"""Fair warning. This is going to be weirder that usual.""

So hear me out. I have been paying attention to this Yakuza issue with ps4 saves not transferring to ps5 and it seems it may not be the only game having this problem and by ommission and assumptions it's gone unnoticed.

I have to think that the issue has to be a technical one. There's no way an rpg that is crossplay wouldn't want to be cross-save as well. That makes me nervous about other games like AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk that are also crossplay.

Control got heat for only allowing the Ultimate edition to upgrade, but what if they knew the older version's saves wouldn't transfer either. Also the Spider-man remaster won't allow save transfer as well. So that's three.

I am no tech guy and this may be the concerns of an overthinker, but it bares considering that saves may not be as easy to transfer from one system to the other this time.

It could explain the new crunch time situation at CDPR after they promised they wouldn't. If they hit a snag like this they would grind their way to a solution (or they just told people what they wanted to hear).",t2_1dbv0e0c

I keep seeing Demon’s Souls and Miles Morales but Sackboy and Destruction All-Stars gets no love, I have a feeling that Destruction All-Stars is going to be a sleeper hit and Sackboy: A Big Adventure is also refreshing especially since LittleBigPlanet is my favorite PS3 game of all time.

Could we see a digital trade in option in console gaming's future?,"It's not something I expect to see with this generation, but as consumers become more and more digital I fully expect in a generation or two to see consoles go the route of Digital Only.

With that in mind, I've thought about the possibility of the PS Store some time down the line offering trade ins. You buy a game at $70, and after you've decided you won't get any use out of it you have an option to delete it from your account forever for a small credit to the PS Store of like $10 or whatever. I think it could give incentive for players to spend more money with PS over the long term if they took this approach.

I ended up just adding pretty much all of the album. Especially Marvel's Spider-Man &amp; Detroit Become Human (I know it's not exclusive any more)

Seems like Sony’s collaboration with AMD may have been successful,"I’ve seen quite few people speculating this in r/AMD 

[*Road to PS5 Presentation Mark Cerny says*](https://youtu.be/ph8LyNIT9sg?t=1564) - “If you see a similar discrete GPU available as a PC card at roughly the same time as we release our console, that means our collaboration with AMD succeeded.”

**Among other cards Navi 22 has been shown in a recent [leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/j06xcd/number_of_cus_of_navi_23_navi_31_van_gogh_cezanne/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) to have 40 CUs @ 2.5 GHz which is very similar to the PS5 GPU (36 CUs @ 2.23 GHz). PS5 has 90% of the CUs and 90% of the clockspeed.** 🤔

1440p 60fps is the way to go next gen,"Hear me out before keyboard warrioring please.

I've noticed a trend where 4K 60fps games as well as 4K 30fps games look like current gen visually(as in texture quality and the overall look of a game, not resolution). Examples of this are Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Godfall, Final Fantasy 16, Kena Bridge of spirits, Spider Man: Miles Morales and Halo Infinite. On the other hand you have very few games that genuinely look next gen. Like a handful at most. And one of these games is confirmed to run at 1440p(Demon Souls remake). Then you also have the unreal engine 5 tech demo(not a game but it still counts) which also runs at 1440p. The only other two I can think of is horizon forbidden west and black myth wukong. The former will probably be 4K 30fps knowing Sony but its going to be cross gen so a lot of power can be devoted to realistic graphics since its basically going to be an amped up version of a PS4 game. As for the latter, we do know that is 60fps and seems very unlikely to run at 4K on console judging by how advanced the graphics look compared to other next gen games. If games which look like PS4 games are bottlenecked at 4K 30 or 4K 60 there's no way in hell Black Myth Wukong can run 4K 60 so its most likely 1440p 60 like the tech demo and demon souls remake. 

Anyway, the bottom line is for a game to actually look like a genuine next gen game it has to be 1440p or sacrifice other areas like frame rate as well as being very limited in size which would be a huge turn off for some gamers such as myself who prioritise frame rate over resolution. 

1440p is a perfect compromise. 4K is a monolithic leap that is really unnecessary. Usually each gen the jump tends to be around 300p. PS1 to PS2 was 144p to 480p which is just over 300p. PS2 to PS3 was 480 to 720p which is a 240p jump. PS3 to PS4 was 720 to 1080p jump so 360p. If we go from 1080p to 1440p that would still be an above average leap at 360p difference. We all noticed the sharp resolution quality increase when we switched from 3 to 4 so why wouldn't the same happen with 1440p. 4K on the other hand is excessive. Why jump 1080 pixels all of a sudden? Not only is this uncalled for but like I said, it also sacrifices frame rate and ultimately weakens the graphical quality of games by using so much of the GPU's power so that the actual graphical quality of games look like last gen. 1440p 60fps is a much more well rounded solution that benefits everyone and is more beneficial towards both graphics and gameplay. Besides a needlessly large jump in resolution that people will get used to pretty quickly, there is nothing to lose from this.

Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013. What do you guys think how PS5 will perform throughout its life cycle?,"So this is more of a technical discussion I guess. I've been thinking a bit about the PS4 lately in an effort to understand how the PS5s life cycle may play out.

And basically three major questions have emerged:

1. was the PS4 really underpowered when it launched?

2. How come resolution and framerate didn't really get worse throughout its life cycle even as games became more visually impressive?

3. What does that mean for PS5?

I'd like to give my own two cents on this but I'm very curious to hear your takes on this since I most propably missed some stuff.

Was the PS4 underpowered? Looking back at 2013 I don't actually think it was. But the specs were certainly less impressive than PS5 today. Everyone (me included) constantly trashes PS4s CPU but at launch it was propably somewhere around Intel i3. Not too bad. The 1.84tf wasn't too bad either. Definitely not high end but still mid range. The 8gb of DDR5 on the other hand were really impressive. This was during a time when we were debating wether you needed 2gb of video RAM. All in all I'd say PS4 was a mid range system compared to PS5 which sits in the higher mid range.

So why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time? Especially during the Xbox360/PS3 era there was a clear trend towards games performing worse later in the generation. In 2006/7 you'd actually see some 720p 60fps AAA titles. Later on it was more like 540p25fps.

This didn't really happen for PS4 though and I don't really have an answer for that. At launch most PS4 games were ~900p 30fps and I can't say it has gotten much worse over time. In fact during 2015 I'd say performance actually got better with lots of games hitting 1080p30fps or 900p60fps. I don't really have an answer for this one since PS4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required years of experience to unlock its power. My guess is that games didn't get that much more demanding with PC gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals (judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example). This generation didn't really have a Crysis that completely blew away the status quo.

Now to my final question. What does that mean for PS5? While PS5 is more powerful than PS4 was back in the day I'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot.

If the life cycle does in fact turn out similarly to PS5 I think the status quo will be 4K 60fps without ray tracing and 30fps with ray tracing. However the UE5 demo from this summer tells a different story. It was super impressive but only ran at 1440p 30fps. I could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding. In that case I think it is absolutely crucial that PS5 has a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low res image to something that at least resembles 4K resolution. Otherwise I fear we will see the issue where lots of games will be ""dynamic 4K 30fps"" but will dip wayy below 4K most of the time, resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a 4K display.

What do you guys think about this? Did I miss something? Did I get something wrong? What's your take on PS4s performance throughout its life cycle and how do you anticipate PS5 will compare?",t2_5p6btf8r

Rise Gamers! Turkish Gamers are in a very bad situation. Please help us to get regional pricing,"Hi. Let me get straight to the point. I am asking for the help of all gamers around the world so Turkish Playstation users can also enjoy the great exclusives you guys do.  
  
Playstation Turkey recently increased the prices of some games to enormous amounts. For example, the new Avengers game costs 679 Turkish liras (87 US $) or Need for Speed Heat costs 709 Turkish liras (91 US $). So with these prices, we can only buy 3 games if we save all of our monthly minimum wage (2.324 Turkish liras). Let me also add that lots of people in Turkey earn a minimum wage because there is a  lack of jobs, even people who graduate from universities could end up in a minimum wage job which is not enough for anything.   
  
Let me also add that, this economical situation of our country is of course not the problem of Sony. We are also people just like you, I may or not support this goverment but I have the right to enjoy games as much as other people from other contries do. Just because I am born in this country, should not mean that I should not enjoy the things that you guys do. Other companies help with their pricing so we can also play games but Sony does not. For example 20$ indie games cost around 32 Turkish Liras on Steam so we can also enjoy them. Another example for Steam could be Cyberpunk 2077 costing 249 turkish liras. With these pricing examples, we can afford them by saving money for a few weeks/months. Microsoft also offers us Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for 45 Turkish Liras a month so we can enjoy as much as you guys do.  
  
But when it comes to Sony, they don't do anything. I also want to enjoy the new upcoming God of War Ragnarok or the new Demon's Souls but at this rate they are going to cost 800-900 turkish liras which is far from affordable. And even worse the PS5 is probably going to cost arond 8000 Turkish Liras (1020 US$) because of the heavy taxes of our country.  
  
What I am asking from Sony is to give Turkish players a regional pricing. If they don't want this because of the abuse that other gamers from other countries can do (buying from us because its cheaper) they could make it so that only people with Turkish ID's would be able to buy from the Turkish store.  
  
And from you guys and girls, from you fellow Gamers. I am asking for your support. Please support us so we can also enjoy that new God of War game, even that cute Bugsnax game together. I don't want to be forced to wait for the hope of getting these new games on ps plus when they come to that service 4 years later. I just want to enjoy these games together with my fellow gamers around the world.",t2_di948

Game boost mode for ps4 games,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

He was not talking about BC but Game boost mode for ps4 titles. 

That's a huge fucking announcement that got obscured due to not understanding what he was talking about at the time due to missing info.

PS concerning the flair, I don't really think this is specualtion but more of a realization and confirmation that most didn't pick up on yet.",t2_oyx1u

A lot of talk about the SSD recently,"The SSD, I know for launch games it will load games almost instantly but I'm wondering down the line, when we get to the back end of the generation will developers be able to eat up this quick load time to the point we experience load times as they are now or is this not possible? 

I understand that they wouldn't want to, but I'm not sure if it was possible, that as the games they make get more demanding and as they try to squeeze every last bit out of the system to make what they are trying to achieve, that the SSD can't keep up to the point we get back to longer load times again. I only say this because it's like on any new system, it starts out fast but as time goes on it starts to get slower to the point where menus are a bit more laggy etc.",t2_zh5di

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling. Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is. I just think that this huge boost in speed will open the door to much more amazing and beautiful looking first party games with even bigger worlds and even more detailed environments than previously imagined for next generation.",t2_tlwzh7f

PS5 checkerboard rendering?,"With Digital Foundry's recent analysis of Demons Souls indicating a 1440p/60fps rendering target, it occurred to me that I don't recall hearing (and haven't been able to uncover) anything about a native checkerboarding solution for PS5. For those unaware, the PS4 Pro had dedicated hardware to interpolate and fill in missing pixels from incomplete 4K frames using previous frames (aka ""checkerboard rendering""), giving a much better visual approximation of 4K than upscaling, but without the performance cost of native 4K.

It seemed logical that Demon's Souls could *possibly* target a CB4k/60fps display if Sony has included similar checkerboarding hardware in the PS5. A partial 1920x2160 frame (whose missing 1920 horizontal pixels could be CB'ed to complete a full 4K frame) does contain 12% more pixels than a native 1440p one (4,147,200 pixels vs 3,686,400), but that does put it at least potentially within optimization reach for Demon's Souls. I would consider this somewhat unlikely for Demon's, given that Bluepoint is on record as preferring the simpler approach of temporal injection of 1440p into a 4K framebuffer in the Shadow of the Colossus remaster. Regardless, having the option of checkerboarding on the PS5 could put higher-detail performance modes within reach of many future titles, rather than forcing a strict compromise of ""performance = 1440p, detail = 4K"".

I can see why Sony might not have drawn attention to checkerboarding with the PS5, as it would likely stoke fanboy allegations of the console being too weak for ""real 4K"" etc, but given how well it was implemented in the PS4 Pro, it's hard for me to imagine them excluding it for any reason other than the already high expense of the hardware. I know there are robust software-based checkerboarding solutions out there, and 1440p titles from last-gen like Uncharted 4 / LL and TLoU2 did really well with their overall image quality and detail. But for me the PS4 Pro really proved that checkerboarding is the best technology outside of DLSS for getting high detail at a low performance cost, and if a game could offer me CB4K/60fps vs 1440p/60fps, I'd choose the former almost every time.",t2_l34q1c0

Clearing up PS5 confusions,"1. The PS5 SSD is not that special the component that makes the SSD special is the IO complex. For example this IO complex is responsible for decompression which frees the CPU to process gameplay data.

3. Spider-Man that comes with Miles Morales is a Remaster and this is completely different than increasing few settings in a options menu. This remaster includes ray tracing, new assets, increased city density and it took many developers time and effort. 

4. PS4 controller DualShock 4 is only able to play PS4 games on PS5. The reason why we are not able to play PS5 only games with DualShock 4 is that the PS5 only games are designed to fully utilise the DualSense controller that includes gameplay functions.",t2_13cvoc

Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I’ve ever had. And here are my tips if you ever decide to camp out for one.,"As the title says, I’ve managed to secure a pre order at my GameStop to get my PS5, and I still can’t believe it honestly. Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it’s been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they’ll have available, if it’s okay to start a line overnight, what they’re store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don’t show up at 6AM thinking that you’re going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5’s available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don’t have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don’t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It’s going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what’s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other’s backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You’re all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who’s unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don’t be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it’ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who’s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that’s awesome, but if you don’t just make sure you don’t take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I’ll say this, I wasn’t going to go either, but something just told me “fuck it, if there aren’t any then just go back home”, but I’m telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you’ll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren’t able to secure a PS5, eventually you won’t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don’t lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can’t believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you’re local weather! Bring completely charged electronics &amp; of course wear your masks!",t2_6cu42drr

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What we don’t do so much in is multiplayer.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;But, no, I was referencing more with the things like “GTA 5 Online,” or you look at “Call of Duty,” or “Fortnite,” or any of those experiences. Worldwide Studios, like I say, we’ve been going really heavy into story-driven gaming. The power of the narrative. Big, spectacular experiences. But not a whole lot in the multiplayer side of things,  
&gt;  
&gt;**I think that’s an area where you will likely see us start to make more noise in the new term**.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.


&amp;nbsp;

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",t2_civ38

Now the thing is, we both want to play cyberpunk. But I don’t want to play until they release the PS5 version. So I won’t be playing now.

Would it make sense to buy the game at launch for PS4, and then loan it to my little bro to play. And then when the PS5 upgrade comes about, start playing it myself then? Would that work? Do I need to be careful about registering to my account first or something?

We’d likely split the cost of the game.",t2_3setnc5e

"Nippon Marathon 2 Is Apparently Getting a Kickstarter (29th on) (I'm unrelated, just a fan)","So while everyone is playing Fall Guys, I have been playing for the last year or so+, Nippon Marathon, it's honestly Fall Guys on crack (but came a lot earlier), being like this weird japanese game show but reality thing where there is a humanoid dog in a shirt and scarf battling an old japanese man in a school girl outfit, etc. I really liked it, and I had found out that there is going to be a kickstarter for this game on the 29th, and it's apparently getting physical (which implies console release, and they even kind of point out that in the info), and like, I'm so damn ready for this beautiful jank mess of a game to hopefully get a sequel.

First game:

&amp;#x200B;

Idk, seemed worth mentioning, I probably plan on supporting the kickstarter, and I'm pretty excited after finding out about it post playing on it (on pc) with my friend (remote play anywhere, ie we social distanced)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else a fan of the first one? I for one am excited for a sequel, though I hope they don't try to jack of the graphics above their talents, and it hurts the game itself (like trine 3, rip)

This isn't promotional, I have no relation to this product, heck I don't even know what country this game was made in, I just love it, and it seemed worth noting that it's getting a kickstarter (especially since the first game was pretty great for couch co op, which is a dying breed sadly)",t2_1ff828s4

I hope PS5 will allow us to do this.(regarding save scumming),"on PS4 if you want to back up a save to USB you have to close the game to do the back up task, that's really irritating especially when you go after 2 or more conflicting Trophies (i.e. Endings) or when forging an equipment which have RNG skills and you are looking for a specific skill on that equipment until you're running out of resources if you didn't get what you want you can go to your backed up save. i know PS5 can boot up games fast and i'll be where i left the game in few seconds after backing up my save but still doing that without shutting down the game is more convenient for us Save-Scummers.
Sorry for any grammar mistake, English isn't my mother tongue.

TL;DR i hope PS5 allows us to back up saves to USB while the game is still running.",t2_11qhec
Am I the only one hoping for the ability to delete trophy lists if you've earned say less than 10% of the trophies for a game?,"I'm really hoping for the ability to delete trophy lists if you've earned a certain percentage or less in a game. You'll occasionally buy a game, realise it's not for you, then consign it to the dust never to be played again. Problem is you've earned a trophy for it and now it's stuck in your trophy list forever at 1%. Maybe this is just my inner perfectionist speaking and it's probably just a pipe dream, but one can only hope.",t2_8n3a9uv

I want to see people open up their PS5,"I'm curious to see the internal differences between the digital and the disc versions. I opened up my PS4 last week and the disc unit is massive and now I'm wondering what implications/benefits its absence could bring to a console. Smaller, more efficient or quieter fan, smaller power unit, ease to clean up is what I can think of without much effort. They could even leave a spot to add a second SSD, which is very unlikely, but it would be awesome.",t2_16j7vb
Can I use my Scuf for Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War?,"So I know the Duel Shock 4 controller will not be compatible with next gen PS5 games, but Cold War is going to be released on PS4 as well. Does this mean I can use my scuf to play Cold War on PS5? Or am I only going to be able to use it on the Warzone game mode? I’m hoping that since it is being released on PS4 that I can still use it.",t2_7jsr3ay8
With the PlayStation+ Collection being PS5 exclusive there’s a chance games will be enhanced.,"I’ve been thinking, since the collection is for PS5 only the games would probably need to have an optimization patch. Meaning older games like my all time favorite Bloodborne should have better frame rates at the very least. 

Do you all think this is far fetched to assume? 
My main reasoning for this speculation is the fact that “PS+ collection for ps5 only” should equal to games in the collection enhanced in some way to utilize the PS5’s capabilities.",t2_61ga2z81

Who here is refugee from geforce now?,"After using gfn for nearly 3 years and having virtually all of my favourite games removed from the service - I am coming to ps5 so I have more actual ownership of my games. Gfn is a great service don't get me wrong and has given me access to a lot of my old steam games (having no suitable pc) but after having virtually all my fighting games removed along with all my racing games, enough is enough. Gfn plays perfectly well and gives reasonable graphics at 1080p, but it's not without its faults. Small amounts of lag, sub par rigs for certain games - these are all problems I am looking to overcome with getting a ps5. Finally I will be able to buy a game, knowing it won't be removed, play it without lag, and enjoy 4k.

So I was wondering, who else is in the same position or who is a renegade from stadia?",t2_1f4f8i8l

Just get a replacement. I've seen a lot of people worried, waiting for next year for PS5 just because of the viral launch issues from every console.

 Chances you'll get a defective system are low *(but not impossible, obviously...)* and if you do, that's what the standard warranty is for!

Things are a bit stale here so we're going to turn on media posting. That way you can upload images, gifs and whatnot. Please note, we still have rules and just because a post is in pic/gif form doesn't mean it can bypass the rules. Here a recap on a few of the rules that are most likely to be violated.

**Prohibited Content**

* Memes &amp; Shitposts
* Twitter reactions/A reaction from someone on the internet
* Commonly posted concepts
* Incites console wars/flamebait/pcmr
* Misinformation/Misleading posts
* Duplicate of a topic/issue/news that has already been posted

**Title Guidelines**

* Clickbait, editorialized, sensationalized, misleading titles, or attempting to draw attention to the post.
* Vague, generalised, unclear titles. Titles must describe the content of the post.
* Post about a specific game must include the name of the game in the title.

If all goes well, we might continue this but for now, let's give it a test run. We want to see how this impacts the sub before we decide to move forward with how media posting is handled here.

Sony should capitalize on gyro-aiming this generation.,"Gyro aiming is a way of minimizing the precision gap between controllers versus mouse&amp;keyboard. The use of gyro aiming doesn't replace the the right analog stick, but instead is used merely for fine-tuning. For those unfamiliar, here are a few videos illustrating in different ways its surprising potential for shooter games:

————

[\[Halo with gyro aiming\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqaz6SxnwnI&amp;t=1s)

[\[Linus Tech Tips\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qlZmXnE1mw)

[\[Motion Controls and the Rejection of Progress\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=binPB4YbWmM&amp;ab_channel=Nerrel)

————

 Unfortunately, gyro aiming is often misunderstood. Here are common arguments I see against it, and why they aren't compelling:

**I wouldn't use it.** That's fine. But others would like to, and making it optional can leave everyone happy.

**It shouldn't be mandatory.** To my knowledge, no shooter has ever made gyro aiming mandatory.

**It would be expensive.** Gyro sensors are relatively inexpensive and wouldn't require any novel technology.

**It hinders accessibility.** More options increases accessibility.

**It's a gimmick.** Gyro aiming requires minimal movement and provides enhanced precision, unlike certain previous implementations of motion controls that have rightly been regarded as gimmicky.

**Not enough people care about it.** That's quickly changing as more and more people come to realize its potential.

————

On the other hand, there are good arguments in favor of gyro aiming. Most importantly, joysticks are intrinsically limited for aiming; gyro aiming enables a finer degree of precision. This

* fine-tunes the controls.
* enhances player agency.
* raises the skill ceiling without necessarily raising the skill floor.
* reduces the need to rely on auto-aim as a crutch.

————

One of the significant but underappreciated differences between the PS5 and XBX is that the PS5's controller enables gyro-aiming while the XBX's controller does not. However, there's been little effort by Sony to capitalize on this advantage. This is nothing new—the PS4 controller has a gyro sensor, but gyro aiming often wasn't even implemented in PS4's first-person shooters. This strikes me as a missed opportunity.

If you agree, I suggest reaching out to Sony via social media. The technology is already there—it's just up to Sony to take advantage of it.",t2_gxwjj

(Unpopular Opinion?) There is absolutely not a lack of content or information coming from Sony,"First let me say that I've enjoyed hanging out on this subreddit during the build up to PS5 and I've seen some really great posts on here, in fact I changed from a long time lurker to poster because of this sub!

I must say however that recently (especially the last week), I've seen several people commenting that there's nothing coming from Sony and they're getting frustrated with the lack of info.

I'm not sure if its because I'm an older gamer (started on snes for reference lol) but this comes across as such impatience to me when I see it. Am I the only one still riding the hype from the showcase that was exactly 2 weeks ago? 

Not to mention the continuous blog posts giving more tid bits. Sure they've not shown the UI but what they have shown me is great looking games that I cant wait to play.

And you know what? I had no idea what the UI on any console I've ever owned would look like before I switched it on and I honestly think it adds to the wonder of using your shiny new console for the very first time. Surpises can be great!

Help me understand Ray Tracing (Spider-Man PS4 remastered) Honest question.," I'm not a pc gamer, so I'm not used to Ray Tracing. 

So from what I heard and know, Ray Tracing allow light to better reflects on surface and to create better reflection. (I can be wrong) 

And as you all know, today this photo of Spider-Man Ps4 remastered came to life. 

[https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv](https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv)

But I feel like there's something wrong.

With how high Peter is and that camera angle, is that normal to see all the street and the pedestrians below him? 

And also is Ray Tracing supposed to be ""like a mirror""? I mean is it supposed to have a 100% reflection of what is on the other side/angle? Is it too exaggerated in the photo or is this really what is Ray Tracing? 

I feel like this is just because it's the beggining of it on consoles so Devs doesn't have a standpoint (except on Pc)

All good things come to those people who wait,"Hello 

I hope you are having a safe journey through 2020. I have seen many posts regarding PlayStation’s silence and wanted to add something to the discussion. So here it goes: 

One thing I know from Sony and PlayStation’s marketing team is they are Marketing Gods amongst men. They know that selling something when it’s sold out is not the best idea. 

There is even a study from University of Alberta and according to them 

“An empty store shelf tempts shoppers to buy the next best thing” 

This means if they start advertising without any stock they might end up selling more of their competitors products. 

In addition, in my opinion PS5’s 

The Load times are better 

The controller is better 

The launch games are better 

The first year games are better 

The third party support is better

Backwards compatible first party games are better 

The UI is better (subjective) 

Also just saying combined with the two IO co processors the CPU is going to be better 

In addition with the cache scrubbers and the higher clock speed on the GPU is going to run better 

All in all just wait all good things will come to those who wait. Only 6 weeks to go.

I’m not a big fan of the Netflix-like subscription model for games. 
I was really excited to try out services like PS Now/Game pass, but unfortunately I never touched 90% of the mediocre games they offer in the library. 

Maybe it’s just me or how I treat video games as a form of entertainment. 
It’s not like watching an average popcorn flick on Netflix and have a good time. 
I just can’t invest my time in a mediocre game and have fun. There’s nothing worse than playing a bad game. 

There are some occasional big games added to the library and majority of the users seem to be waiting only for those. And this seriously raises doubts about the value for money aspect with these subscription models.

First-Party Titles Run At 4K@30 or Dynamic 4K@60?,"So on the Spider-Man Remastered page, it says, [Link](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered/);

&gt;Experience the critically acclaimed hit with updated graphical assets and in stunning dynamic 4K/HDR\*. And experience swinging through New York and combat as an experienced Spider-Man with an optional performance mode that takes advantage of Insomniac’s temporal injection for dynamic 4K/60fps\*.

We have also been told that;

&gt;and the same optional performance mode offered on Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, allowing you to finally play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate.

We also know that Demon's Souls, at least in the trailer, according to DF was rendering internally at 1440p and then upscaled to 4K so basically Dynamic 4K right?

Does this mean that in quality mode the games will run at 4K@30fps with ray-tracing and in performance mode, it will run in Dynamic 4K@60fps without downgrading graphical fidelity so raytracing still on?

Even if it is up to the dev, it seems that Miles Morales, Spider-Man Remastered, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Demon's Souls will have these 2 choices, they seem to be using Insomniac's Temporal Injection method,

&gt;which takes a lower internal resolution and uses prior/upcoming frames as well as AA to fill in the details to get a 4K image. It's another way of upscaling, like checkerboarding is, but temporal injection gives a cleaner image. Before DLSS 2.0 it was probably the best quality upscaling method.

He said the game loaded from PS5 Menu to gameplay in 2 Seconds. That's astounding. That's not loading into game seeing Menu then hitting play. That's hitting play from PS5 UI to game. 2 Seconds. Insane. 

This is probably old news but had to share anyway.


From Article

We start PS5s menu screen. Before I can see to much Mike moves over to the Kena Icon selects it and presses play. Two seconds later we're in the game. That's the load Josh says perhaps sensing my astonishment. They have a whole thing set up where you can do transitions and it's very nice,but frankly it doesn't have time to play the animation he adds. It just loads the game so fast.",t2_10cf08
"It seems that playing video games early has a great positive effect onto your memory, says this neuroscience study. So ready for the PS5?","While a number of studies have shown that video games can cause structural or functional changes in the brain, including the activation of areas responsible for attention or spatial and visual skills, this new work reveals lasting beneficial effects on memory when practiced in childhood. A recent study from Neuroscience researchers of the University of Barcelona finds that playing video games during childhood improves memory sustainably.

Study is available here: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full)

This new research, was carried out by a team of researchers from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and involving 27 subjects between the ages of 18 and 40, showed that beneficial cognitive changes could occur years after giving up playing games. video games.

I game since my very young age of 6, i can confirm that my memory still works fine at 40+. 

What about you? Did you start gaming long time ago? Are you going to start with PS5? Do you think that these studies should enable governments to support gaming better? Let's maybe having a super ministry/secretary (in US) of Sport and eSport? or of Video Games? (seriously...)

Now with the development of more realistic and immersive games, would the result be the same? Or do you think the next generation games that will come from PS5 soon may affect gamers differently?",t2_5lq1nflj

The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue.,"""Fair warning. This is going to be weirder that usual.""

So hear me out. I have been paying attention to this Yakuza issue with ps4 saves not transferring to ps5 and it seems it may not be the only game having this problem and by ommission and assumptions it's gone unnoticed.

I have to think that the issue has to be a technical one. There's no way an rpg that is crossplay wouldn't want to be cross-save as well. That makes me nervous about other games like AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk that are also crossplay.

Control got heat for only allowing the Ultimate edition to upgrade, but what if they knew the older version's saves wouldn't transfer either. Also the Spider-man remaster won't allow save transfer as well. So that's three.

I am no tech guy and this may be the concerns of an overthinker, but it bares considering that saves may not be as easy to transfer from one system to the other this time.

It could explain the new crunch time situation at CDPR after they promised they wouldn't. If they hit a snag like this they would grind their way to a solution (or they just told people what they wanted to hear).",t2_1dbv0e0c

Could we see a digital trade in option in console gaming's future?,"It's not something I expect to see with this generation, but as consumers become more and more digital I fully expect in a generation or two to see consoles go the route of Digital Only.

With that in mind, I've thought about the possibility of the PS Store some time down the line offering trade ins. You buy a game at $70, and after you've decided you won't get any use out of it you have an option to delete it from your account forever for a small credit to the PS Store of like $10 or whatever.

I hope the tradition for PS4 exclusives to have incredible soundtracks carries over to the PS5,"I've only had a PS4, none of the PlayStation's before, so I'm only judging on the current gen of exclusives.

I personally think that the current gen PS exclusives have had some of, if not the best soundtracks I've ever heard in games. So I hope that the PS5 exclusives will continue having incredible soundtracks. 

Most of the time I'd say there's a couples tracks from each album that I'd listen outside of the game, but when I was making a Spotify playlist with game music. I ended up just adding pretty much all of the album. Especially Marvel's Spider-Man &amp; Detroit Become Human (I know it's not exclusive any more)

Seems like Sony’s collaboration with AMD may have been successful,"I’ve seen quite few people speculating this in r/AMD 

[*Road to PS5 Presentation Mark Cerny says*](https://youtu.be/ph8LyNIT9sg?t=1564) - “If you see a similar discrete GPU available as a PC card at roughly the same time as we release our console, that means our collaboration with AMD succeeded.”

**Among other cards Navi 22 has been shown in a recent [leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/j06xcd/number_of_cus_of_navi_23_navi_31_van_gogh_cezanne/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) to have 40 CUs @ 2.5 GHz which is very similar to the PS5 GPU (36 CUs @ 2.23 GHz). PS5 has 90% of the CUs and 90% of the clockspeed.** 🤔

1440p 60fps is the way to go next gen,"Hear me out before keyboard warrioring please.

I've noticed a trend where 4K 60fps games as well as 4K 30fps games look like current gen visually(as in texture quality and the overall look of a game, not resolution). Examples of this are Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Godfall, Final Fantasy 16, Kena Bridge of spirits, Spider Man: Miles Morales and Halo Infinite. On the other hand you have very few games that genuinely look next gen. Like a handful at most. And one of these games is confirmed to run at 1440p(Demon Souls remake). Then you also have the unreal engine 5 tech demo(not a game but it still counts) which also runs at 1440p. The only other two I can think of is horizon forbidden west and black myth wukong. The former will probably be 4K 30fps knowing Sony but its going to be cross gen so a lot of power can be devoted to realistic graphics since its basically going to be an amped up version of a PS4 game. As for the latter, we do know that is 60fps and seems very unlikely to run at 4K on console judging by how advanced the graphics look compared to other next gen games. If games which look like PS4 games are bottlenecked at 4K 30 or 4K 60 there's no way in hell Black Myth Wukong can run 4K 60 so its most likely 1440p 60 like the tech demo and demon souls remake. 

Anyway, the bottom line is for a game to actually look like a genuine next gen game it has to be 1440p or sacrifice other areas like frame rate as well as being very limited in size which would be a huge turn off for some gamers such as myself who prioritise frame rate over resolution. 

1440p is a perfect compromise. 4K is a monolithic leap that is really unnecessary. Usually each gen the jump tends to be around 300p. PS1 to PS2 was 144p to 480p which is just over 300p. PS2 to PS3 was 480 to 720p which is a 240p jump. PS3 to PS4 was 720 to 1080p jump so 360p. If we go from 1080p to 1440p that would still be an above average leap at 360p difference. We all noticed the sharp resolution quality increase when we switched from 3 to 4 so why wouldn't the same happen with 1440p. 4K on the other hand is excessive. Why jump 1080 pixels all of a sudden? Not only is this uncalled for but like I said, it also sacrifices frame rate and ultimately weakens the graphical quality of games by using so much of the GPU's power so that the actual graphical quality of games look like last gen. 1440p 60fps is a much more well rounded solution that benefits everyone and is more beneficial towards both graphics and gameplay. Besides a needlessly large jump in resolution that people will get used to pretty quickly, there is nothing to lose from this.

I just realized how good announcing a game and releasing it in the same year/(max) next year feels good.,A lot of games announced 2-3+ years early and it sucks. I wish devs would announce it when they are a bit close to the development final version. Spider-Man MM &amp; Demons Souls are good examples.,t2_lfrdee1
Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013. What do you guys think how PS5 will perform throughout its life cycle?,"So this is more of a technical discussion I guess. I've been thinking a bit about the PS4 lately in an effort to understand how the PS5s life cycle may play out.

And basically three major questions have emerged:

1. was the PS4 really underpowered when it launched?

2. How come resolution and framerate didn't really get worse throughout its life cycle even as games became more visually impressive?

3. What does that mean for PS5?

I'd like to give my own two cents on this but I'm very curious to hear your takes on this since I most propably missed some stuff.

Was the PS4 underpowered? Looking back at 2013 I don't actually think it was. But the specs were certainly less impressive than PS5 today. Everyone (me included) constantly trashes PS4s CPU but at launch it was propably somewhere around Intel i3. Not too bad. The 1.84tf wasn't too bad either. Definitely not high end but still mid range. The 8gb of DDR5 on the other hand were really impressive. This was during a time when we were debating wether you needed 2gb of video RAM. All in all I'd say PS4 was a mid range system compared to PS5 which sits in the higher mid range.

So why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time? Especially during the Xbox360/PS3 era there was a clear trend towards games performing worse later in the generation. In 2006/7 you'd actually see some 720p 60fps AAA titles. Later on it was more like 540p25fps.

This didn't really happen for PS4 though and I don't really have an answer for that. At launch most PS4 games were ~900p 30fps and I can't say it has gotten much worse over time. In fact during 2015 I'd say performance actually got better with lots of games hitting 1080p30fps or 900p60fps. I don't really have an answer for this one since PS4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required years of experience to unlock its power. My guess is that games didn't get that much more demanding with PC gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals (judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example). This generation didn't really have a Crysis that completely blew away the status quo.

Now to my final question. What does that mean for PS5? While PS5 is more powerful than PS4 was back in the day I'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot.

If the life cycle does in fact turn out similarly to PS5 I think the status quo will be 4K 60fps without ray tracing and 30fps with ray tracing. However the UE5 demo from this summer tells a different story. It was super impressive but only ran at 1440p 30fps. I could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding. In that case I think it is absolutely crucial that PS5 has a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low res image to something that at least resembles 4K resolution. Otherwise I fear we will see the issue where lots of games will be ""dynamic 4K 30fps"" but will dip wayy below 4K most of the time, resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a 4K display.

What do you guys think about this? Did I miss something? Did I get something wrong? What's your take on PS4s performance throughout its life cycle and how do you anticipate PS5 will compare?",t2_5p6btf8r

Rise Gamers! Turkish Gamers are in a very bad situation. Please help us to get regional pricing,"Hi. Let me get straight to the point. I am asking for the help of all gamers around the world so Turkish Playstation users can also enjoy the great exclusives you guys do.  
  
Playstation Turkey recently increased the prices of some games to enormous amounts. For example, the new Avengers game costs 679 Turkish liras (87 US $) or Need for Speed Heat costs 709 Turkish liras (91 US $). So with these prices, we can only buy 3 games if we save all of our monthly minimum wage (2.324 Turkish liras). Let me also add that lots of people in Turkey earn a minimum wage because there is a  lack of jobs, even people who graduate from universities could end up in a minimum wage job which is not enough for anything.   
  
Let me also add that, this economical situation of our country is of course not the problem of Sony. We are also people just like you, I may or not support this goverment but I have the right to enjoy games as much as other people from other contries do. Just because I am born in this country, should not mean that I should not enjoy the things that you guys do. Other companies help with their pricing so we can also play games but Sony does not. For example 20$ indie games cost around 32 Turkish Liras on Steam so we can also enjoy them. Another example for Steam could be Cyberpunk 2077 costing 249 turkish liras. With these pricing examples, we can afford them by saving money for a few weeks/months. Microsoft also offers us Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for 45 Turkish Liras a month so we can enjoy as much as you guys do.  
  
But when it comes to Sony, they don't do anything. I also want to enjoy the new upcoming God of War Ragnarok or the new Demon's Souls but at this rate they are going to cost 800-900 turkish liras which is far from affordable. And even worse the PS5 is probably going to cost arond 8000 Turkish Liras (1020 US$) because of the heavy taxes of our country.  
  
What I am asking from Sony is to give Turkish players a regional pricing. If they don't want this because of the abuse that other gamers from other countries can do (buying from us because its cheaper) they could make it so that only people with Turkish ID's would be able to buy from the Turkish store.  
  
And from you guys and girls, from you fellow Gamers. I am asking for your support. Please support us so we can also enjoy that new God of War game, even that cute Bugsnax game together. I don't want to be forced to wait for the hope of getting these new games on ps plus when they come to that service 4 years later. I just want to enjoy these games together with my fellow gamers around the world.",t2_di948

Game boost mode for ps4 games,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

He was not talking about BC but Game boost mode for ps4 titles. 

That's a huge fucking announcement that got obscured due to not understanding what he was talking about at the time due to missing info.

PS concerning the flair, I don't really think this is specualtion but more of a realization and confirmation that most didn't pick up on yet.",t2_oyx1u

A lot of talk about the SSD recently,"The SSD, I know for launch games it will load games almost instantly but I'm wondering down the line, when we get to the back end of the generation will developers be able to eat up this quick load time to the point we experience load times as they are now or is this not possible? 

I understand that they wouldn't want to, but I'm not sure if it was possible, that as the games they make get more demanding and as they try to squeeze every last bit out of the system to make what they are trying to achieve, that the SSD can't keep up to the point we get back to longer load times again. I only say this because it's like on any new system, it starts out fast but as time goes on it starts to get slower to the point where menus are a bit more laggy etc.",t2_zh5di

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling. Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is. I just think that this huge boost in speed will open the door to much more amazing and beautiful looking first party games with even bigger worlds and even more detailed environments than previously imagined for next generation.",t2_tlwzh7f

PS5 checkerboard rendering?,"With Digital Foundry's recent analysis of Demons Souls indicating a 1440p/60fps rendering target, it occurred to me that I don't recall hearing (and haven't been able to uncover) anything about a native checkerboarding solution for PS5. For those unaware, the PS4 Pro had dedicated hardware to interpolate and fill in missing pixels from incomplete 4K frames using previous frames (aka ""checkerboard rendering""), giving a much better visual approximation of 4K than upscaling, but without the performance cost of native 4K.

It seemed logical that Demon's Souls could *possibly* target a CB4k/60fps display if Sony has included similar checkerboarding hardware in the PS5. A partial 1920x2160 frame (whose missing 1920 horizontal pixels could be CB'ed to complete a full 4K frame) does contain 12% more pixels than a native 1440p one (4,147,200 pixels vs 3,686,400), but that does put it at least potentially within optimization reach for Demon's Souls. I would consider this somewhat unlikely for Demon's, given that Bluepoint is on record as preferring the simpler approach of temporal injection of 1440p into a 4K framebuffer in the Shadow of the Colossus remaster. Regardless, having the option of checkerboarding on the PS5 could put higher-detail performance modes within reach of many future titles, rather than forcing a strict compromise of ""performance = 1440p, detail = 4K"".

I can see why Sony might not have drawn attention to checkerboarding with the PS5, as it would likely stoke fanboy allegations of the console being too weak for ""real 4K"" etc, but given how well it was implemented in the PS4 Pro, it's hard for me to imagine them excluding it for any reason other than the already high expense of the hardware. I know there are robust software-based checkerboarding solutions out there, and 1440p titles from last-gen like Uncharted 4 / LL and TLoU2 did really well with their overall image quality and detail. But for me the PS4 Pro really proved that checkerboarding is the best technology outside of DLSS for getting high detail at a low performance cost, and if a game could offer me CB4K/60fps vs 1440p/60fps, I'd choose the former almost every time.",t2_l34q1c0
