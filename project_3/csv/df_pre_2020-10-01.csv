with xbox/microsoft now own bethesda i strongli believ they should pull the skyblivion crew into actual busi give them support they need and then launch skyblivion as an offici remast of oblivion i know thi idea might rub some peopl the wrong way and you could technic make the argument that it' an add on mod for skyrim right now but my point is for year i'v watch the small crew of skyblivion dev work their magic and truli give oblivion a much need and appreci make over i think now that xbox ha bethesda they should look at what the skyblivion guy are do draw them into the fold as part of bethesda offici but let them continu do what they want and then re launch oblivion as a remast use what they'v done obvious i am not talk about just take their work i mean bring them into the fold as a dev team do thi oblivion updat on the side to the rest of bethesda to me it' a no brainer bethesda ha alreadi re done skyrim a few time but whi not bring in the skyblivion peopl and let them do oblivion offici now give them the money and resourc to pull it all off definit te vi is probabl   year away at least in the meantim we alreadi have the skyblivion peopl do wonder thing to oblivion so launch it as the offici oblivion remast in the meantim would actual be an amaz idea to hold peopl over until te vi and one thing' for sure a offici oblivion remast in the meantim as an exclus would help establish the elder scroll seri as xbox' now current crown jewel do you think thi is a bad idea how could it not be a good thing at least as a propos,with xbox/microsoft now owning bethesda i strongly believe they should pull the skyblivion crew into actual business give them support they need and then launch skyblivion a an official remaster of oblivion i know this idea might rub some people the wrong way and you could technically make the argument that it's an add on mod for skyrim right now but my point is for year i've watched the small crew of skyblivion devs work their magic and truly give oblivion a much needed and appreciated make over i think now that xbox ha bethesda they should look at what the skyblivion guy are doing draw them into the fold a part of bethesda officially but let them continue doing what they want and then re launch oblivion a a remaster using what they've done obviously i am not talking about just taking their work i mean bring them into the fold a a dev team doing this oblivion update on the side to the rest of bethesda to me it's a no brainer bethesda ha already re done skyrim a few time but why not bring in the skyblivion people and let them do oblivion officially now giving them the money and resource to pull it all off definitively te vi is probably   year away at least in the meantime we already have the skyblivion people doing wonderful thing to oblivion so launching it a the official oblivion remaster in the meantime would actually be an amazing idea to hold people over until te vi and one thing's for sure a official oblivion remaster in the meantime a an exclusive would help establish the elder scroll series a xbox's now current crown jewel do you think this is a bad idea how could it not be a good thing at least a a proposal,0

if you have a xbox one x you might want to hold off on upgrad to the seri x for about a year here' whi don't downvot me into oblivion just yet hear me out i'm not say don't get the seri x i current have a one x and alreadi have my pre order for the seri x after all howev if you alreadi have an xbox one x like me it might not be the upgrad you were expect yet here' whi onli the newest tv' with hdmi   can take full advantag of the power of the seri x to display  at  fp and output uncompress dolbi atmo audio the vast major of peopl with  tv still have hdmi   which is limit to  at  fp and can't output uncompress dolbi atmo audio howev there' veri littl reason to upgrad your tv to hdmi   becaus aaron greenburg said that   will be the standard output   windowscentr com/xbox seri x featur  fp standard output confirm xbox aaron greenberg text today      appear     on the seri x the xbox one x and current hdmi   tv can alreadi do that the biggest reason i want to upgrad to the seri x immedi wa to play next gen game with ray trace howev halo infinit wasn't go to launch with ray trace hope it will after the indefinit delay and neither will valhalla or cyberpunk ray trace on big titl doesn't seem to be come until next year at the earliest so even if you have the latest  tv with hdmi   you'll still just be play next gen game at   with no ray trace which the xbox one x is alreadi capabl of do right now new game will releas on the current gener for the forese futur and smart deliveri make upgrad immedi even less necessari so the onli remain advantag of upgrad from the one x to the seri x right now are faster load time more stabl  framer quick resum faster ui if you have an origin xbox one or xbox one s the seri x is a huge upgrad immedi howev if you have a xbox one x you might want to wait until the big titl are enhanc with ray trace next year the price drop and you don't have to fight the crowd edit other have brought up that your one x will inevit lose valu if you wait to sell it or trade it in so that' anoth factor to consid as well howev price on next gen consol will like drop next year especi black friday sale so it might be a wash,if you have a xbox one x you might want to hold off on upgrading to the series x for about a year here's why don't downvote me into oblivion just yet hear me out i'm not saying don't get the series x i currently have a one x and already have my pre order for the series x after all however if you already have an xbox one x like me it might not be the upgrade you were expecting yet here's why only the newest tv's with hdmi   can take full advantage of the power of the series x to display  at  fps and output uncompressed dolby atmos audio the vast majority of people with  tv still have hdmi   which is limited to  at  fps and can't output uncompressed dolby atmos audio however there's very little reason to upgrade your tv to hdmi   because aaron greenburg said that   will be the standard output   windowscentral com/xbox series x feature  fps standard output confirms xboxs aaron greenberg text today      appear     on the series x the xbox one x and current hdmi   tv can already do that the biggest reason i wanted to upgrade to the series x immediately wa to play next gen game with ray tracing however halo infinite wasn't going to launch with ray tracing hopefully it will after the indefinite delay and neither will valhalla or cyberpunk ray tracing on big title doesn't seem to be coming until next year at the earliest so even if you have the latest  tv with hdmi   you'll still just be playing next gen game at   with no ray tracing which the xbox one x is already capable of doing right now new game will release on the current generation for the foreseeable future and smart delivery make upgrading immediately even le necessary so the only remaining advantage of upgrading from the one x to the series x right now are faster loading time more stable  framerate quick resume faster ui if you have an original xbox one or xbox one s the series x is a huge upgrade immediately however if you have a xbox one x you might want to wait until the big title are enhanced with ray tracing next year the price drop and you don't have to fight the crowd edit others have brought up that your one x will inevitably lose value if you wait to sell it or trade it in so that's another factor to consider a well however price on next gen console will likely drop next year especially black friday sale so it might be a wash,0

microsoft play a great move by buy zenimax media but they could chang the landscap forev by do one simpl thing i m surpris they ve not talk about it time is crucial do it asap microsoft whi ha phil spencer / todd howard / pete better yet microsoft or zenimax not even hint at thi yet mod creation club utilis it i m over the moon about thi deal it s noth but good news but i feel microsoft are just not realis someth here as if i wa them i d get to work on announc it asap microsoft now essenti own the right to these excel franchis timeless classic that peopl still play to thi day elder scroll skyrim / fallout  now these were the first titl to receiv mod support on consol which is great it s a excel babi step but then came along creation club okay initi a step backward but let s not underestim it usag here it provid more incom toward the studio and at the same time give it user more content with the excel benefit of be grade content that let you expand your game whilst also still enabl achiev so a lot of peopl and i know a lot of peopl do thi they get one of these game buy creation club content love it for ad to the game and onc they get  they get the real reward which is actual mod that complet chang the game to someth new but that s after they ve done everyth so by then they usual drop it for pc which is just unfet access to brilliant content nice howev it s been year sinc these were creat and the flak ha settl down and a lot of peopl do not want to play on pc and not get achiev on xbox they don t care about steam achiev they care about their progress on xbox we re their main charact are ton of peopl some peopl also just have prefer there is dlc that ha come or is come to pc which is just insan sheer insan and the work gone into these thing are beyond crazi whi is microsoft not help the dev ship these idea to consol unifi it all for pc / xbox do it now it s insan here are some exampl fallout  fallout miami trailer   be/aptajvtjhf8 apologis for the lack of fallout  exampl i person don t mod it much becaus i prefer to play it on xbox and i current don t have  on it elder scroll skyrim familar face amaz mod it let you do new game plu but your old charact are charact in your new play through beyond skyrim creat all of tamriel within skyrim exampl   be/ocrwn2emgbw skyblivion   be/68uuezgppxw ordin essenti a add massiv amount of skill tree perk i think it s over  new skill i have play a lot of these on pc ton of them i ve even miss out hundr more i m just list some exampl but now microsoft own both end of the pipelin come on and do someth alreadi i love mod on my pc but i also get bore when i know my progress isn t realli go forward on the system i game mainli on which is xbox and the choic would be love to have i d even pay for these mod and wish their wa creation club version to support both microsoft and the creators/modd the option should exist and now there is no excus none and it benefit everyon involv ye these are old game but game pass is the perfect platform to grow thi still let s be honest tes6 is year away thi is the perfect time to get thi go i play skyrim special edit to thi day on xbox still so do my friend not everyon want to have to use a pc and a load order download to do thi peopl also want their progress and achiev earn abl with mod on so certifi these mod charg me i don t care just do it and those oppos to creation club well you can t complain sinc these would be free in the mod list anyway or you have pc there is noth wrong with choic creation club content is spare short and usual expens there is no tri to pretend it s not but it give us the abil to get achiev and it work with the game give it an authent certifi feel so whi ha the content just forzen to a halt it s discount a lot which is nice but if microsoft allow or begun the process of get the back log of thousand of mod onto it sure thi would lower the cost over time sinc there would be enough content there to of cours offset such thing and whi is the space for these mod so short it s aw that thi hasn t been request or talk about much and the potenti to have an strong instant effect that is posit for both pc user and xbox user right now is there yet i feel microsoft will just sit on it and do noth you know what els thi would do show up soni and how their polici are kinda of bad in thi day and age it would also give a lot of peopl reason to stick with xbox/pc and game pass it s on equal foot than even let playstat have access to tes6 playstat user could have tes6 but if mod / creation club and all these amaz idea were made offici that would mean a lot more to mani mani peopl and have tes6 on playstat wouldn t mean a thing in contrast becaus the real experi is on xbox/ pc it s alreadi on pc so what i m tri to say is we as a commun need to get the ball roll spread the word and more done we need a dialogu with microsoft to let them know how import thi is becaus i m pretti sick of have to use pc for thi i want it offici i want to have choic and i don t care how i want my bethesda game to last me a lot longer and surpris me everyday whilst i can get achiev and progress we need to hear what microsoft think becaus no real roadblock is in the way now it should be a thing i just don t see much mention sinc the deal ha gone down i d expect it to be high prioriti anyway i m just pretti sick of hope i want inform and i imagin so mani other do too edit il also add shut these creator down and reset everyth to zero would be the dumbest move that could possibl be play,microsoft played a great move by buying

backwards but let s not underestimate it usage here it provides more income towards the studio and at the same time give it user more content with the excellent benefit of being graded content that let you expand your game whilst also still enabling achievement so a lot of people and i know a lot of people do this they get one of these game buy creation club content love it for adding to the game and once they get  they get the real reward which is actual mod that completely change the game to something new but that s after they ve done everything so by then they usually drop it for pc which is just unfetted access to brilliant content nice however it s been year since these were created and the flak ha settled down and a lot of people do not want to play on pc and not get achievement on xbox they don t care about steam achievement they care about their progression on xbox we re their main character are ton of people some people also just have preference there is dlc that ha come or is coming to pc which is just insane sheer insanity and the work gone into these thing are beyond crazy why is microsoft not helping the devs ship these idea to console unifying it all for pc / xbox do it now it s insane here are some example fallout  fallout miami trailer   be/aptajvtjhf8 apologise for the lack of fallout  example i personally don t mod it much because i prefer to play it on xbox and i currently don t have  on it elder scroll skyrim familar face amazing mod it let you do new game plus but your old character are character in your new play through beyond skyrim creating all of tamriel within skyrim example   be/ocrwn2emgbw skyblivion   be/68uuezgppxw ordinator essentially a add massive amount of skill tree perk i think it s over  new skill i have played a lot of these on pc ton of them i ve even missed out hundred more i m just listing some example but now microsoft own both end of the pipeline come on and do something already i love modding on my pc but i also get bored when i know my progress isn t really going forward on the system i game mainly on which is xbox and the choice would be lovely to have i d even pay for these mod and wished their wa creation club version to support both microsoft and the creators/modders the option should exist and now there is no excuse none and it benefit everyone involved yes these are old game but game pas is the perfect platform to grow this still let s be honest tes6 is year away this is the perfect time to get this going i play skyrim special edition to this day on xbox still so do my friend not everyone want to have to use a pc and a load order download to do this people also want their progress and achievement earn able with mod on so certify these mod charge me i don t care just do it and those opposed to creation club well you can t complain since these would be free in the mod list anyway or you have pc there is nothing wrong with choice creation club content is spare short and usually expensive there is no trying to pretend it s not but it give u the ability to get achievement and it work with the game giving it an authentic certified feel so why ha the content just forzen to a halt it s discounted a lot which is nice but if microsoft allowed or begun the process of getting the back log of thousand of mod onto it surely this would lower the cost over time since there would be enough content there to of course offset such thing and why is the space for these mod so short it s awful that this hasn t been requested or talked about much and the potential to have an strong instant effect that is positive for both pc user and xbox user right now is there yet i feel microsoft will just sit on it and do nothing you know what else this would do show up sony and how their policy are kinda of bad in this day and age it would also give a lot of people reason to stick with xbox/pc and game pas it s on equal footing than even letting playstation have access to tes6 playstation user could have tes6 but if modding / creation club and all these amazing idea were made official that would mean a lot more to many many people and having tes6 on playstation wouldn t mean a thing in contrast because the real experience is on xbox/ pc it s already on pc so what i m trying to say is we a a community need to get the ball rolling spread the word and more done we need a dialogue with microsoft to let them know how important this is because i m pretty sick of having to use pc for this i want it official i want to have choice and i don t care how i want my bethesda game to last me a lot longer and surprise me everyday whilst i can get achievement and progress we need to hear what microsoft think because no real roadblock is in the way now it should be a thing i just don t see much mentioned since the deal ha gone down i d expect it to be high priority anyway i m just pretty sick of hoping i want information and i imagine so many others do too edit il also add shutting these creator down and resetting everything to zero would be the dumbest move that could possibly be played,0

my   cyberpunk control tldr i now have a fulli function cyberpunk  control for a total of   by fix a faulti one i bought so i ve been mean to get a spare xbox control for quit a while i current onli have the one that came with my cyberpunk xbox one x i have never open one of these up but i love tinker so i wa look for cheap faulti control with the intent of get one with some joystick drift and tri to fix it my ebay search result in a faulti cyberpunk control auction the descript onli said condit is for part or not work so i decid to chanc it i figur sinc it s current sold out and retail on amazon for   is anyon actual pay thi for them insan i could pay about   and still afford a second hand part control that might be in poor condit do a shell swap and come in under what a new control would cost me surprisingli i end up win the auction for just over   and when it arriv these were my initi observ  someth is rattl around insid the case but not everi time i shook the control  lb kept get stuck  visual the control look new/ in realli good shape i plug it in and here s what i got after use thi awesom littl control tester i saw tronicsfix use gamepad tester   tester com/   tester com/ you can see the initi test here i screen record it to show some friend   youtub com/watch v bgzezwnao1i   youtub com/watch v bgzezwnao1i here were my observ  onc you click lb it becam stuck  rt wa complet unrespons  everyth els wa realli respons and work well what surpris me wa just how well everyth els work the joystick were veri respons as you can see in the video i open the control up and veri quickli saw what the issu were the thing rattl around wa a magnet that wa meant to be in the rt assembl it kept get stuck on the main rumbl motor which explain whi it onli rattl sometim the magnet case wa complet snap off on the right side explain whi there wa no sign of life in rt and the lb issu wa due to the left hand side assembl be broken too but thi time at the hing right side break   com/cdd7rtu   com/cdd7rtu left side break better photo below   com/8qp2pn1   com/8qp2pn1 specul time i am assum thi wa just a case of rage gone wrong right mayb it just fell but i think it s far more like that the previou owner rage what do you think it took me a few minut to find the right part i tri googl for xbox trigger frame and trigger assembl and got noth but what end up show actual result wa trigger holder go figur quick note if you re do your own repair doubl check what control you have becaus i almost order the older style control version i had the option of either go with a part from aliexpress or ebay but the total cost shipment includ onli differ by    on ebay and i didn t have to wait a month of deliveri if i had a repair shop i d absolut go with aliexpress and make a bulk order but for a one off ebay made more sens plu it wa onli   includ ship right side new and old comparison   com/fpelonm   com/fpelonm left side new and old comparison   com/fkjibgw   com/fkjibgw the actual repair wa easier than i thought after figur out what the best way of get the pin out that wa hold the assembl togeth it wa a fairli easi process remov pin gt pick up the spring and the pin gt move over the magnet into the new holder gt align it into the control gt pop the pin in partial gt put the spring in place gt push the pin in all the way gt put the rumbl motor on gt place the trigger cap on gt screw it in i m actual a littl disappoint it all went as smoothli as it did but thi wa so much fun i m actual look for a new control project as we speak hope you enjoy read

have never opened one of these up but i love tinkering so i wa looking for cheap faulty controller with the intention of getting one with some joystick drift and trying to fix it my ebay search resulted in a faulty cyberpunk controller auction the description only said condition is for part or not working so i decided to chance it i figured since it s currently sold out and retailing on amazon for   is anyone actually paying this for them insanity i could pay about   and still afford a second hand part controller that might be in poor condition do a shell swap and come in under what a new controller would cost me surprisingly i ended up winning the auction for just over   and when it arrived these were my initial observation  something is rattling around inside the case but not every time i shook the controller  lb kept getting stuck  visually the controller looked new/ in really good shape i plugged it in and here s what i got after using this awesome little controller

everything else worked the joystick were very responsive a you can see in the video i opened the controller up and very quickly saw what the issue were the thing rattling around wa a magnet that wa meant to be in the rt assembly it kept getting stuck on the main rumble motor which explains why it only rattled sometimes the magnet casing wa completely snapped off on the right side explaining why there wa no sign of life in rt and the lb issue wa due to the left hand side assembly being broken too but this time at the hinge right side break   com/cdd7rtu   com/cdd7rtu left side break better

wait at  until  to get my ps5 secur at gamestop wa honestli one of the most fun and memor experi i ve ever had and here are my tip if you ever decid to camp out for one as the titl say i ve manag to secur a pre order at my gamestop to get my ps5 and i still can t believ it honestli becaus i know thi will be a low avail item here are my tip on how i got mine and how the wait for it wa even more bearabl  if it s been announc that there will be some in store call them and get as much concret inform as you can find out how mani they ll have avail if it s okay to start a line overnight what they re store hour are etc  the most import thing you need to know about camp overnight for a consol is that you need to have the gut and determin to do so don t show up at  think that you re go to get one becaus trust me there will be peopl who are more determin to secur a consol than that in new york for the nintendo switch there are peopl who would wait liter  day straight to be first in line to get their and to meet reggi and doug bowser even if you live in a small town be readi to get there at least   hour earli i live in a small town and i show up at  and i wa the last one at my gamestop to get a ps5 but not too much longer after i arriv there were wave of peopl show up so i got veri lucki and show up at the perfect time there were  ps5 s avail the first guy show up at   guy show up at  the  guy show up around  and i show up at  do not reli on live in a small town to guarante that there will be ani avail becaus news get around fast thank to the internet  alongsid determin a lot of peopl just simpli don t have the time to camp outsid store like that due to have to work take care of kid etc the onli reason you should make room for do someth like thi is if you are realli determin to get up realli earli and commit to wait for it don t think you can squeez it in without make room in your schedul for it  befriend the peopl you are wait in line with it s go to be a long wait and how much these peopl are will to be cordial with you is realli what s go to determin if the wait is go to be agon or fli right by you bring multipl chair one for yourself and some to offer other should they forget to bring one due to them rush over to the store and forget to bring their own if you want be will to buy or offer them some snack and drink and most importantli set up thi bond that ensur that everyon wait there will have each other s back should anyon need to use the bathroom joke around engag in convers and be charismat to make sure everyon feel comfort with you you re all go to be wait at least  hour togeth after all no reason to let thing be awkward and believ me everyon will want to no one want to sit there for hour next to a guy who s unfriendli and keep to himself the entir time  thi actual bring me to have to use the restroom or want to get someth to eat if you do leav depend on how big the line is don t be gone for too long   minut top you just look like a dick be gone for so long lol and it ll be awkward for everyon els save your seat now if you have a friend or rel who s will to drive to your locat or wait with you then that s awesom but if you don t just make sure you don t take too long  my final tip is actual for befor you have decid whether or not to go through with wait in line for a long time i ll say thi i wasn t go to go either but someth just told me fuck it if there aren t ani then just go back home but i m tell you that feel of know that you absolut will get your consol all you need to do is wait it will heavili outweigh ani doubt you have about wait anymor you ll be too happi to even care lol and there ya go and rememb if you aren t abl to secur a ps5 eventu you won t be abl to go into a larg retail without see them everywher so don t lose sleep over it good luck to you all edit also one thing i can t believ i forgot but should be taken veri serious when decid whether or not to wait in line make sure to bring comfort cloth and check you re local weather bring complet charg electron of cours wear your mask,waiting at  until  to get my ps5 secured at gamestop wa honestly one of the most fun and memorable experience i ve ever had and here are my tip if you ever decide to camp out for one a the title say i ve managed to secure a pre order at my gamestop to get my ps5 and i still can t believe it honestly because i know this will be a low availability item here are my tip on how i got mine and how the wait for it wa even more bearable  if it s been announced that there will be some in store call them and get a much concrete information a you can find out how many they ll have available if it s okay to start a line overnight what they re store hour are etc  the most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the gut and determination to do so don t show up at  thinking that you re going to get one because trust me there will be people who are more determined to secure a console than that in new york for the nintendo switch there are people who would wait literally  day straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet reggie and doug bowser even if you live in a small town be ready to get there at least   hour early i live in a small town and i showed up at  and i wa the last one at my gamestop to get a ps5 but not too much longer after i arrived there were wave of people showing up so i got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time there were  ps5 s available the first guy showed up at   guy showed up at  the  guy showed up around  and i showed up at  do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news get around fast thanks to the internet  alongside determination a lot of people just simply don t have the time to camp outside store like that due to having to work take care of kid etc the only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it don t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it  befriend the people you are waiting in line with it s going to be a long wait and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you bring multiple chair one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own if you want be willing to buy or offer them some snack and drink and most importantly set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other s back should anyone need to use the bathroom joke around engage in conversation and be charismatic to make sure everyone feel comfortable with you you re all going to be waiting at least  hour together after all no reason to let thing be awkward and believe me everyone will want to no one want to sit there for hour next to a guy who s unfriendly and keep to himself the entire time  this actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat if you do leave depending on how big the line is don t be gone for too long   minute top you just look like a dick being gone for so long lol and it ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat now if you have a friend or relative who s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that s awesome but if you don t just make sure you don t take too long  my final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time i ll say this i wasn t going to go either but something just told me fuck it if there aren t any then just go back home but i m telling you that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console all you need to do is wait it will heavily outweigh any doubt you have about waiting anymore you ll be too happy to even care lol and there ya go and remember if you aren t able to secure a ps5 eventually you won t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere so don t lose sleep over it good luck to you all edit also one thing i can t believe i forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you re local weather bring completely charged electronics of course wear your mask,1

up off of the floor when we experienc the first few minut of devil may cri on our ps2 on christma morn have never experienc graphic like that on a consol befor the two of us huddl under our cover absolut terrifi dure a  am session of resid evil or silent hill as i mention befor now that i m a dad and don t have nearli as much time to devot to play video game as i would like that said as i look back there are a few titl that i would collect lose my shit over and make the time to play through if they happen to find their way onto the newest gener of consol ssx tricki the origin and subsequ follow up to the seri definit did a great job showcas the capabl of that gener of consol howev ssx tricki brought the beauti graphic head to head with incred satisfi and complet outrag over the top game physic while ad it own uniqu brand of humor custom and addict level system all while string togeth ridicul over the top superhuman trick combin not seen sinc the day of toni hawk pro skater to see thi titl brought to the next gener of consol with a graphic overhaul and dear god just imagin what could be done with the haptic feedback of the new ps5 control imagin how addict satisfi it would feel to push off a jump and feel the snap or pop of the board or liter feel the powder crunch underfoot after land a ridicul sweet combo there s just so much potenti hear it make me a littl crazi oddworld stranger wrath i can t honestli rememb how i stumbl across thi game but it wa one that i feel didn t quit get the prais in attent it deserv i could be wrong about thi perhap that wa just my percept but i wa left so satisfi after play through thi titl how seamlessli they were abl to blend third person  platform and first person shooter wa just incred and the fact that you could almost play through the entir game use one or the other speak volum the humor lace throughout the creativ of live ammunit and with a fantast storylin to boot thi is one of those titl that genuin left me sad upon complet as i just simpli didn t want it to end tiger wood circa earli mid  damn wa thi titl addict i know they are still pump out titl but they are just not the same no it wasn t a ridicul realist golf simul and that s what made it great the inject of and well balanc mix of arcad style gameplay and simul incred satisfi and addict swing mechan silli custom and the genuin hilari in game commentari from david feherdi gari mccord made these titl so much damn fun noth sinc ha quit been abl to captur the magic thi seri onc had they need to eas up on the simul and inject a hint more of the arcad style shenanigan bring thi seri back to it glori day hell you didn t even have to like golf to enjoy those game wipeout i mean come on thi game is playstat nough said twist metal ehem see abov what are some of your,if they revived an old favorite via sequel or remake for the new generation of console what would title would get you genuinely excited i absolutely love video game and although i would never really call myself a hard core gamer especially after having kid and very little time to devote to the hobby i ve been around long enough to have my fair share of memorable video game moment the soul crushing experience of beating ghoul ghost only to find it demanding a second play through to officially beat the game neighborhood friend leaning on my windowsill mouth agape when we discovered the blood code for mortal kombat my little brother and i picking our jaw up off of the floor when we experienced the first few minute of devil may cry on our ps2 on christmas morning having never experienced graphic like that on a console before the two of u huddled under our cover absolutely terrified during a  am session of resident evil or silent hill a i mentioned before now that i m a dad and don t have nearly a much time to devote to playing video game a i would like that said a i look back there are a few title that i would collectively lose my shit over and make the time to play through if they happened to find their way onto the newest generation of console ssx tricky the original and subsequent follow ups to the series definitely did a great job showcasing the capability of that generation of console however ssx tricky brought the beautiful graphic head to head with incredibly satisfying and completely outrageous over the top game physic while adding it own unique brand of humor customization and addictive leveling system all while stringing together ridiculous over the top superhuman trick combination not seen since the day of tony hawk pro skater to see this title brought to the next generation of console with a graphical overhaul and dear god just imagine what could be done with the haptic feedback of the new ps5 controller imagine how addictively satisfying it would feel to push off a jump and feel the snap or pop of the board or literally feeling the powder crunch underfoot after landing a ridiculously sweet combo there s just so much potential hear it make me a little crazy oddworld stranger wrath i can t honestly remember how i stumbled across this game but it wa one that i feel didn t quite get the praise in attention it deserved i could be wrong about this perhaps that wa just my perception but i wa left so satisfied after playing through this title how seamlessly they were able to blend third person  platformer and first person shooter wa just incredible and the fact that you could almost play through the entire game using one or the other speaks volume the humor laced throughout the creativity of live ammunition and with a fantastic storyline to boot this is one of those title that genuinely left me sad upon completion a i just simply didn t want it to end tiger wood circa early mid  damn wa this title addictive i know they are still pumping out title but they are just not the same no it wasn t a ridiculously realistic golf simulator and that s what made it great the injection of and well balanced mix of arcade style gameplay and simulation incredibly satisfying and addictive swing mechanic silly customizations and the genuinely hilarious in game commentary from david feherdy gary mccord made these title so much damn fun nothing since ha quite been able to capture the magic this series once had they need to ease up on the simulation and inject a hint more of the arcade style shenanigan bring this series back to it glory day hell you didn t even have to like golf to enjoy those game wipeout i mean come on this game is playstation nough said twisted metal ehem see above what are some of yours,1

disappoint uk/pal box art news ps5 to keep the ps4 plain white text spine art for soni game when we got box art for mile moral in pal territori we saw that it had a logo on the side someth that almost never happen for soni first parti pal game apart from spiderman it led mani of us to hope that thi would carri over to all next gen first parti titl we had also theoris that perhap it wa just for spiderman so it would look similar to the first game' as it appear to be replic the box art too unfortun that is not the case pun not intend the box art for sackboy ha been reveal and it ha the curs plain white text on it' spine if you are wonder the mean of thi i made a more detail post   reddit com/r/ps5/comments/iei649/a_european_uk_wish_for_ps5/ about thi back when we got that news complet with pic for non pal reader but i'll give you a brief summari if you buy a pal first parti soni game you get a gener white/black text on the spine of the box thi alon wouldn't be a problem as the ps2 in europ had it and it' quit aesthet pleas the problem is that it is onli soni game with thi instead of everyon like for the ps2 thi leav your collect on your shelf look like a collect of game and pirat movi you bought in a foreign countri on your vacat i wa person hold out hope for some chang thi gener but it look like i am go o have to look into the custom covers/slipcov commun to fix thi unfortun realiti thi is especi disappoint as soni promis a more global approach thi gener but thi notion seem to have been just pr speak faq gt i like the plain text on the ps2 as do i but it need to be all or noth all logo or all plain it make some look like lazi knock off if they'r alon gt whi do you care so much as a physic owner i like be abl to look on a shelf and see the game' i'v sunk mani hour into   of the time i will finish a game and then it will sit on the shelf is it that wrong to care for how a display piec look gt just use the altern cover i would if we got those most pal territori get health warn on the insid cover instead of the revers cover found on spiderman and god of war gt just print out the us one also not an option as soni doesn't put these scan up for piraci reason mean that if you get one it' a user' own scan which are far from a good qualiti or you have to import an empti case which start to stack up as a costli endeavour if you'r replac a dozen first parti game gt first world problem much you'r right but game is a first world pastim if i am spend as much as i am on a game it' not unreason to have packag that look good gt ocd no just have a shelf like that shelf want to have some consist in the game on that shelf,disappointing uk/pal box art news ps5 to keep the ps4 plain white text spine art for sony game when we got box art for mile morale

next gen first party title we had also theorised that perhaps it wa just for spiderman so it would look similar to the first game's a it appeared to be replicating the box art too unfortunately that is not the case pun not intended the box art for sackboy ha been revealed and it ha the cursed plain white text on it's spine if you are wondering the meaning of this i made a more detailed post   reddit com/r/ps5/comments/iei649/a_european_uk_wish_for_ps5/ about this back when we got that news complete with pic for non pal reader but i'll give you a brief summary if you buy a pal first party sony game you get a generic white/black text on the spine of the box this alone wouldn't be a problem a the ps2 in europe had it and it's quite aesthetically pleasing the problem is that it is only sony game with this instead of everyone like for the ps2 this leaf your collection on your shelf looking like a collection of game and pirated movie you bought in a foreign country on your vacation i wa personally holding out hope for some change this generation but it look like i am going o have to look into the custom covers/slipcover community to fix this unfortunate reality this is especially disappointing a sony promised a more global approach this generation but this notion seems to have been just pr speak faq gt i like the plain text on the ps2 a do i but it need to be all or nothing all logo or all plain it make some look like lazy knock offs if they're alone gt why do you care so much a a physical owner i like being able to look on a shelf and seeing the game's i've sunk many

territory get health warning on the inside cover instead of the reversible cover found on spiderman and god of war gt just print out the u one also not an option a sony doesn't put these scan up for piracy reason meaning that if you get one it's a user's own scan which are far from a good quality or you have to import an empty case which start to stack up a a costly endeavour if you're replacing a dozen first party game gt first world problem much you're right but gaming is a first world pastime if i am spending a much a i am on a game it's not unreasonable to have packaging that look good gt

taking on the nintendo  sega saturn juggernaut sony started strong by the time the ps3 had really hit it stride with fantastic first party studio acquisition and partnership like naughty dog from software and medium molecule i've always felt that despite owning multiple console pc sony earnt my loyalty there have been some tough moment on ps4 lacking wishlists playtime easy internal medium storage and no backwards compatibility through emulation of our ps1/ps2 collection among others but we've always been able to count on sony to treat u like gamers and not insult the value of our time bringing u first party experience like no other and sharing it with pc other console brother when possible so thank you sony for bringing up welling excitement with the ps5 like never before to the point of this post there are a few franchise which are difficult to imagine life without however it feel like too long already sony can you bring u these in some form or another or will they forever languish lost to competing interest or past memory wipeout series on all sony console there ha been that reliable ultra fast anti grav racing experience the thrill of modern hard electronica thudding

finally getting around to the second most recently it wa very surprising to learn that the first wa moderately well received and the second just so slightly more no other game series a someone who grew up in the '90s ha been able to put such a feeling of wondrous youth and excitement a an adult knack   were that feeling of waking up at  am sneaking into the tv room with a blanket and watching saturday morning cartoon but this time a an adult with a significant other that feeling is priceless in a world where many have lost their wonder magic feeling to the prey of a quick endlessly unsatisfying slot machine type loop the order  this wa a wonderfully cerebral take on the most detailed steampunk city that i've witnessed the story wa gripping the combat wa thrilling and of course there wa no sequel or mention after the mediocre review ripped it apart for being boring unambitious not next gen a glorified walking simulator i am sad to think that this franchise isn't given wing

to sie to keep valuing our intelligence and especially those of u that don't have the money but spend it anyway because we continue to trust in your expertise a gamers and successful innovator and to developer that work with sony keep producing wonderful work resist the temptation to fall prey to company who have a history of buying and running talented studio into the ground push back when the

what kind of game is miss from soni s first parti lineup of game i ve been think a lot about the game soni ha in the oven readi to go over the next few year they have a realli wide varieti of incred success franchis and i don t think there s a lot of worri about whether the ps5 will struggl to find enough titl that by themselv will sell consol but where s their weak what genr is leav the biggest hole in soni studio first parti lineup there are a few area i think soni could stand to invest in first is a militari shooter mayb not first person but someth heavili combat focus with multiplay potenti i m sure the crist thought goe right to socom as it should peopl have been ask for a reboot for a while now and it s for good reason socom wa a tight tactic shooter that gave mani player their first tast of onlin multiplay it would do well with a reboot and could solidifi the ps5 as the complet consol packag the second area soni should look into is a bit ambiti but a  hour open world game like the witcher or red dead or even assassin s creed would be someth gamer could find themselv buy a consol just to play what i mean by thi is a huge open world game that keep player invest in the world and experi long after the main stori is complet soni ha explor open world style game with horizon zero dawn god of war and most recent with ghost of tushima thi ha extra implic becaus xbox ha the bethesda the undisput king of make open world epic final soni need a sci fi game i don t realli know where on the spectrum of sci s game need to fall but with killzon on the shelf collect dust someth need to take it place an argument could be made that horizon meet the sci fi criteria but i m look more in the realm of alien space ship and energi weapon it s a hard genr to perfect but when you do it right it ha last potenti in the world of game i think soni could see thi last potenti turn into a larg adopt of consol,what kind of game is missing from sony s first party lineup of game i ve been thinking a lot about the game sony ha in the oven ready to go over the next few year they have a really wide variety of incredibly successful franchise and i don t think there s a lot of worry about whether the ps5 will struggle to find enough title that by themselves will sell console but where s their weakness what genre is leaving the biggest hole in sony studio first party lineup there are a few area i think sony could stand to invest in first is a military shooter maybe not first person but something heavily combat focused with multiplayer potential i m sure the crist thought go right to socom a it should people have been asking for a reboot for a while now and it s for good reason socom wa a tight tactical shooter that gave many player their first taste of online multiplayer it would do well with a reboot and could solidify the ps5 a the complete console package the second area sony should look into is a bit ambitious but a  hour open world game like the witcher or red dead or even assassin s creed would be something gamers could find themselves buying a console just to play what i mean by this is a huge open world game that keep player invested in the world and experience long after the main story is complete sony ha explored open world style game with horizon zero dawn god of war and most recently with ghost of tushima this ha extra implication because xbox ha the bethesda the undisputed king of making open world epic finally sony need a sci fi game i don t really know where on the spectrum of sci s game need to fall but with killzone on the shelf collecting dust something need to take it place an argument could be made that horizon meet the sci fi criterion but i m looking more in the realm of alien space ship and energy weapon it s a hard genre to perfect but when you do it right it ha lasting potential in the world of gaming i think sony could see this lasting potential turn into a large adoption of console,1

compar the perform of ps5 to the ps4 in  what do you guy think how ps5 will perform throughout it life cycl so thi is more of a technic discuss i guess i'v been think a bit about the ps4 late in an effort to understand how the ps5 life cycl may play out and basic three major question have emerg  wa the ps4 realli underpow when it launch  how come resolut and framer didn't realli get wors throughout it life cycl even as game becam more visual impress  what doe that mean for ps5 i'd like to give my own two cent on thi but i'm veri curiou to hear your take on thi sinc i most propabl miss some stuff wa the ps4 underpow look back at  i don't actual think it wa but the spec were certainli less impress than ps5 today everyon me includ constantli trash ps4 cpu but at launch it wa propabl somewher around intel i3 not too bad the   wasn't too bad either definit not high end but still mid rang the  of ddr5 on the other hand were realli impress thi wa dure a time when we were debat wether you need  of video ram all in all i'd say ps4 wa a mid rang system compar to ps5 which sit in the higher mid rang so whi did resolut and framer not get wors over time especi dure the xbox360/ps3 era there wa a clear trend toward game perform wors later in the gener in  you'd actual see some   aaa titl later on it wa more like  thi didn't realli happen for ps4 though and i don't realli have an answer for that at launch most ps4 game were   and i can't say it ha gotten much wors over time in fact dure  i'd say perform actual got better with lot of game hit  or  i don't realli have an answer for thi one sinc ps4 didn't have a super complex architectur that would have requir year of experi to unlock it power my guess is that game didn't get that much more demand with pc gamer push toward higher framer rather than visual judg from the slow adopt of ray trace for exampl thi gener didn't realli have a crysi that complet blew away the statu quo now to my final question what doe that mean for ps5 while ps5 is more power than ps4 wa back in the day i'm not sure wether it is actual in a better spot if the life cycl doe in fact turn out similarli to ps5 i think the statu quo will be   without ray trace and  with ray trace howev the ue5 demo from thi summer tell a differ stori it wa super impress but onli ran at   i could imagin a fulli fledg game of that calib be even more demand in that case i think it is absolut crucial that ps5 ha a decent upscal solut so they can reconstruct a low re imag to someth that at least resembl  resolut otherwis i fear we will see the issu where lot of game will be dynam   but will dip wayi below  most of the time result in a realli unstabl imag that would oftentim not hold up on a  display what do you guy think about thi did i miss someth did i get someth wrong what' your take on ps4 perform throughout it life cycl and how do you anticip ps5 will compar,comparing the performance of ps5 to the ps4 in  what do you guy think how ps5 will perform throughout it life cycle so this is more of a technical discussion i guess i've been thinking a bit about the ps4 lately in an effort to understand how the ps5s life cycle may play out and basically three major question have emerged  wa the ps4 really underpowered when it launched  how come resolution and framerate didn't really get worse throughout it life cycle even a game became more visually impressive  what doe that mean for ps5 i'd like to give my own two cent on this but i'm very curious to hear your take on this since i most propably missed some stuff wa the ps4 underpowered looking back at  i don't actually think it wa but the spec were certainly le impressive than ps5 today everyone me included constantly trash ps4s cpu but at launch it wa propably somewhere around intel i3 not too bad the   wasn't too bad either definitely not high end but still mid range the  of ddr5 on the other hand were really impressive this wa during a time when we were debating wether you needed  of video ram all in all i'd say ps4 wa a mid range system compared to ps5 which sits in the higher mid range so why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time especially during the xbox360/ps3 era there wa a clear trend towards game performing worse later in the generation in  you'd actually see some   aaa title later on it wa more like  this didn't really happen for ps4 though and i don't really have an answer for that at launch most ps4 game were   and i can't say it ha gotten much worse over time in fact during  i'd say performance actually got better with lot of game hitting  or  i don't really have an answer for this one since ps4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required year of experience to unlock it power my guess is that game didn't get that much more demanding with pc gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example this generation didn't really have a crysis that completely blew away the status quo now to my final question what doe that mean for ps5 while ps5 is more powerful than ps4 wa back in the day i'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot if the life cycle doe in fact turn out similarly to ps5 i think the status quo will be   without ray tracing and  with ray tracing however the ue5 demo from this summer tell a different story it wa super impressive but only ran at   i could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding in that case i think it is absolutely crucial that ps5 ha a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low re image to something that at least resembles  resolution otherwise i fear we will see the issue where lot of game will be dynamic   but will dip wayy below  most of the time resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a  display what do you guy think about this did i miss something did i get something wrong what's your take on ps4s performance throughout it life cycle and how do you anticipate ps5 will compare,1

sinc the start i even grew up in the citi where it wa develop i had a sign copi of gear of war  back home as well from a midnight releas where some develop were do a sign at a local gamestop gear of war wa the co op shooter my friend and i play in between halo releas we would go through the campaign at schedul time so no one got left behind and when we beat the stori we would play endless round of hord and tri and beat wave  on each map some night we were up until  am for refer i wa  in highschool when  came out when gear of war  came out i wa excit to get back on and clear it with my friend but unfortun they had all grown tire of the seri so me and my younger beat it togeth and i stuck around for a bit of multiplay and hord for a bit no where near as much as  or  it wa the ultim experi i had when i wa a kid but i appreci my brother tag along even if he had no invest to the stori or anyth so by the time gear  came out i wa hesit to play it sinc my brother now live in a differ time zone and doesn't play onlin as much anymor either i had game pass so i download it got in a match of hord just see how it look and felt yup felt like gear alright then i play the stori and stop about halfway through the second act i just wasn't feel it and i pretti much put it out of my mind all togeth then thi weekend i got a mild cold and couldn't work the last few day i figur i could use some action and melodrama so i decid to boot up gear  and sink my teeth in i beat it in less then a coupl day but what a ride the stori wa pretti good honestli i didn't realli appreci swap protagonist after onli one game in the new trilog but i end up prefer kait over jd overal she' just someth differ for the seri and her motiv wa interest enough to get me hook now while i like the stori i love the moment of sheer spectacl there were time when i would drop my jaw when i certain scene would happen i haven't felt so tini in a videogam sinc halo  vers the scarab and i wasn't just tini i wa the scrappi outsid on a mission i wa pretti immers i'd say the visual and sound design just outstand but the gameplay the most i'v ever click in a gear of war game use jack' abil allow me to chang it up and figur out new tactic there were so mani hairpin moment where one shot and one second decid whether or not i wa go to be a splatter on the screen and when i pull it off just fantast or when i wa use the gl lancer and manag to get   drone in one shot dure an intens fight so satisfi and that' the other thing everi firefight wa tens and after each one it onli ramp up and up oh and the boss fight in act  i die countless time but eventu when i overcam it i got that sigh of relief that i honestli haven't had with a game for a while thi game made me feel like a kid again go what the fuck like i did when i wa in highschool with my friend i didn't care too much for the open world i like the side object alright noth memor the compon part kept me check everi nook and cranni and the skiff when it got up to speed wa realli fun to drive but it felt too empti and pad to valid it be there you could'v kept the linear level design and mayb had an option side mission you could either ignor or do along the rout and it'll bring you back to where you were but i guess they were just follow trend or someth i gotta say i didn't expect to write a full review like thi befor  but i wa just surpris how much i actual enjoy thi game i look back on the seri fondli but when i'm away from it i usual just think of it as the big dude shoot at the ugli dude behind a well place wall and kinda just write it

  is the way to go next gen hear me out befor keyboard warrior pleas i'v notic a trend where   game as well as   game look like current gen visual as in textur qualiti and the overal look of a game not resolut exampl of thi are ratchet and clank rift apart godfal final fantasi  kena bridg of spirit spider man mile moral and halo infinit on the other hand you have veri few game that genuin look next gen like a hand at most and one of these game is confirm to run at  demon soul remak then you also have the unreal engin  tech demo not a game but it still count which also run at  the onli other two i can think of is horizon forbidden west and black myth wukong the former will probabl be   know soni but it go to be cross gen so a lot of power can be devot to realist graphic sinc it basic go to be an amp up version of a ps4 game as for the latter we do know that is  and seem veri unlik to run at  on consol judg by how advanc the graphic look compar to other next gen game if game which look like ps4 game are bottleneck at   or   there' no way in hell black myth wukong can run   so it most like   like the tech demo and demon soul remak anyway the bottom line is for a game to actual look like a genuin next gen game it ha to be  or sacrific other area like frame rate as well as be veri limit in size which would be a huge turn off for some gamer such as myself who prioritis frame rate over resolut  is a perfect compromis  is a monolith leap that is realli unnecessari usual each gen the jump tend to be around  ps1 to ps2 wa  to  which is just over  ps2 to ps3 wa  to  which is a  jump ps3 to ps4 wa  to  jump so  if we go from  to  that would still be an abov averag leap at  differ we all notic the sharp resolut qualiti increas when we switch from  to  so whi wouldn't the same happen with   on the other hand is excess whi jump  pixel all of a sudden not onli is thi uncal for but like i said it also sacrific frame rate and ultim weaken the graphic qualiti of game by use so much of the gpu' power so that the actual graphic qualiti of game look like last gen   is a much more well round solut that benefit everyon and is more benefici toward both graphic and gameplay besid a needlessli larg jump in resolut that peopl will get use to pretti quickli there is noth to lose from thi edit gotta love get downvot to oblivion without rebutt from peopl that didn't even read the

and late i'v realli enjoy ancestor the humankind odyssey other than that the game i play realli aren't exclus to the platform tl dr entertain app are slow and the overal ui feel so cumbersom the ui is as impract today as it wa the day i got the consol you can group game into folder but you can't take certain app out of the entertain folder it take about okay i time it it took exactli   second and  to  click from the home screen just to open netflix netflix dude youtub is doubl the click becaus it' posit further away in the folder of can't take it out thi might sound ridicul but i'v at so mani cold dinner just tri to set up a movi i want to watch call me crazi but i don't rememb xbox' home screen be so insan difficult tl dr parti up is easili  harder than i rememb xbox be start a parti sure lemm just creat the room okay i i think that' it oh wait i gotta invit the person hah my fault ps4 my consol doesn't speak in the tradit sens but you get the idea tl dr if you think you have memori

game of the month offer tl dr the control suck ass tl dr gameplay recod is far superior on xbox i'v sinc gotten use to thi but damn i miss rememb how much better clip gameplay wa on xbox have they made improv tell me about the rabbit okay i think i'v said enough there' some more i look for that i'm not get into but my updat final downloa alright it still ha to instal here' my question to budget

green over there compar,i heard a rumor that the devs are a little more active in paying attention to the customer want more than the ps4 devs is this true and could you possibly link me to example life ha pulled me from xbox but if this is true i would much rather migrate my library for an even slightly improved user experience more about me and my experience tl dr's by the paragraph tl dr don't choose a system based off what other people have if they actually play the same game a you they probably don't have the time to i think it's been about five year since i switched at the time i

play really aren't exclusive to the platform tl dr entertainment apps are slow and the overall ui feel so cumbersome the ui is a impractical today a it wa the day i got the console you can group game into folder but you can't take certain apps out of the entertainment folder it take about okay i timed it it took exactly   second and  to  click from the home screen just to open netflix netflix dude youtube is double the click because it's positioned further away in the folder of can't take it out this might sound ridiculous but i've at so many cold dinner just trying to set up a movie i want to watch call me crazy but i don't remember xbox's home screen being so insanely difficult tl dr partying up is easily  harder than i remember xbox being starting a party sure lemme just create the room okay i i think that's it oh wait i gotta invite the person hah my fault ps4 my console doesn't speak in the traditional sense but you get the idea tl dr if you think you have memory think again it is entirely possible to have a significant amount of storage left that would more than cover the size of a game update but apparently you have to be able to load up twice the amount of complete storage the game requires or something like that simply because that's how it is sony rep this meant that in order to update red dead redemption or call of duty mw i needed to have about   free at all time luckily i got the terabyte console to house these game on just buy the disc that is a wonderful idea except rdr2 is a disc i feel cheated out of multiple title i didn't mention starwars battlefront because i got it in the free game of the month offer tl dr the controller suck as tl dr gameplay recoding is far superior on xbox i've since gotten used to this but damn i miss remembering how much better clipping gameplay wa on xbox have they made improvement tell me about the rabbit okay i think i've said enough there's some more i look for that i'm not getting into but my update finally downloa alright it still ha to install here's my question to budget gamers do you think buying an xbox one will still be a reasonable purchase after the new generation release and to everyone doe any of this sound like your experience on xbox i think i remember the grass actually being pretty green over there comparatively,0
