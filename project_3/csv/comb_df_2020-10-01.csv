"I said ""fuck it"" and pulled the trigger on a one X today.","I have mainly gamed on a Switch and 3DS for the last few years. I had a ps4 but I honestly hate Sony's business ethics and I felt no connection to the first party games besides God of War. I wanted a newer system come next month. Me and my wife were able to secure a ps5 for my son and I was left in the dust. I couldn't get a hold of an Xbox series S or X, and no ps5.  I felt stupid for calling stores asking if they had any pre-orders left and when I was laughed at during a call it really sucked. 

I hate having a 1080p console on a 4k tv. It looks awful and unnatural. I wanted a new system that could hit true 4K. Sony's fake checkerboard crap wasn't going to cut it. I got a refurbished xbox one X with a one year warranty for $280. I figured that since Xbox was behind on 1st party support right now this could give me the time to play games like Far Cry 5 before jumping to the new gen. At least two years.

So I am now on the Microsoft band wagon and I hope I am very impressed when this thing comes on on the 7th.

Xbox Series X seems to be outselling Playstation 5 in Brazil,"
The pre orders for XSX and XSS only started yesterday (Sep-29) in Brazil. PS5 pre orders, on the other hand, started at the same world-wide date (Sep-17) here.

After 12 days PS5s are not sold out yet in any of the top 3 national retailers. And several retailers are now giving 5-10% discounts.

About 24 hours after launch, XSX sold out in 2 of those 3 largest retailers. [xsx_link1](https://www.americanas.com.br/produto/2116373642/console-xbox-series-x-1tb), [xsx_link2](https://m.pontofrio.com.br/console-xbox-series-x-1tb-controle-sem-fio-preto-55014095.html)

Broken connector on Xbox One Front Panel Board,"Heya Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

So as I was cleaning out my xbox one, I accidentally broke of the connector that  the front ribbon cable connects to on the front panel board. Instead of changing out the hole front panel board, do you think I could just solder on a new connector for the ribbon cable?

The light in the xbox logo turns on when I start the concole (via the controller), but I can't seem to manually press the buttons for on/off or eject the disk. Not a big proglem, but still annoying...

My 4-month-old Elite 2 controller's right bumper isn't working unless I press down firmly right in the middle. Microsoft only offers a 90-day warranty. :/,"I bought an Elite 2 controller from Costco back in late May, so just over 4 months ago. 

Last week I noticed the right bumper wasn't registering fully, and it's continued to get worse. Sometimes it's totally fine, but other times I have to press down firmly right in the middle and outward areas don't register at all. This has been hugely frustrating in Warzone, as trying to throw C4 etc. has sometimes not worked responsively.

Microsoft only offers a 90-day warranty of course (sooo ridiculous that a $180 controller is only covered that amount of time!) but I'm hoping Costco will honor it. Thing is, I don't even know if they still stock them (it was an online exclusive at the time).

I was looking at homemade DIY repairs and someone said rubbing alcohol can help sticky buttons (in case it's actually sticky and not broken), but another person said it can damage the internal battery... does anyone know if I'd be OK pouring a tiny bit of rubbing alcohol along the corners? Any other suggestions?

The rules are simple. Write the game name which code you want and I will look up here a few hours later, randomly picking out winners for them. (Randomly as in I pick them out not a bot, so some flavor text is never a bad thing, I like jokes and puns btw)

Not Recovering Skyrim Saves from Cloud,"Hi, so I picked up a new Xbox (haven't had one in awhile) figured I'd load my modded Skyrim saves from the cloud and pick up where I left off. Well the damn thing is only loading a couple of saves from a damn good while back- like it's probably missing about a week's worth of progress. Pretty annoying. Anyone experience this/know how to recover other saves- or at least make sure my system saves are synced up with the cloud so this doesn't happen again?

A few noob questions,"Hi all,

I've pre-ordered the XSX and am excited to rejoin the Xbox world.

My primary goal is to play locally with my wife... I'm skimming through Gamepass and am a little confused on the distinction between 'split screen/screen sharing' vs 'Xbox Live Local Co-op'

Can we play the latter on one console? Minecraft Dungeons as an example.

If we were to get a second console, would we need a second GamePass account to play Xbox live local co-op together?

Xbox one S random beeping sounds from system while turned off,"Hey there!

"""X took too long to start""","Hey guys, I've been having a problem on One S for the past couple months now. I've looked in the tech support post and saw that some people have the same issues BUT all of the fixes that have worked for them have done nothing for me so I was hoping if anyone has any other suggestions.. I'm willing to try almost anything at this point.

So here's the issue: NBA 2K20 was working perfectly fine for a few months but up until around May/June iirc the game was beginning to freeze at certain spots. Eventually, this led to the infamous ""X took too long to start"" error. I had believed this to be exclusively a fault with the game itself but soon it started to affect the rest of the console. 
It began with Monster Hunter: World but restarting my console would make MH:W work again. It then spread to FIFA 20 as well and when this happened that's when it really got out of control. Essentially all my games eventually couldn't start except for like Skate 3 which I found strange 😂 

Also on top of most of my games breaking, my Xbox also runs extremely slowly to the point that the scrolling sound on the dashboard sounds like a Transformer. 

So my question, other than if anyone has any solutions, would be is it possible for the actual NBA 2K20 disc to be causing these issues? I tested this on my brother's Xbox as well, also a One S, and it caused the same issues so that's why I now suspect the game itself. 

So some more information that might be relevant to troubleshooting and maybe help someone going through the same:
https://windowsreport.com/took-too-long-to-start-xbox-one-error/

As of today I've officially exhausted every solution on the list and then some. I've re-installed the game online, offline, with the latest update, without the latest update, I've reset to factory settings many times (both keeping games and apps and deleting everything), cleared reserved space, persistent storage, changed my location,, turned instant-on off etc. I think you get the point lol

Umm so it seems okay when I uninstall 2K so I feel confident that it was the game. I'm not convinced it's the disc because when 2K was on Game Pass and I installed it without the disc it still did the same. Is it possible for a game to (effectively) brick a console like this because I was under the assumption that corrupted saved data and files causes this error so I'm really confused.

Is there any chance for finding Series X in the UK soon?,"Hey guys, I hope this post doesn't go down into oblivion.

I live in Turkey and the price of Series X has been revealed as 9300 TRY, which is roughly 1196 USD/930 GBP. As expected, it is completely irrational to buy one here.

Fortunately, my brother is studying/working in the UK and planning to visit me in the beginning of December. PS5 prices are even crazier in Turkey so we first went after that one but since the game prices of the console have also skyrocketed here, it is not really logical or sustainable to buy one and bring it here as I won't be able to buy many games. It is also out of stock as well. So long live the Game  Pass.

We have been checking Amazon and a few other retailers via tracking websites but we haven't seen any single restock of Series X for a while. Do you guys know any place for tracking the stock or buying one? There are some scalpers on ebay but we are on a tight budget anyway and I don't want to go down that route because of trust issues.

Is there any chance that we will be able to find Series X in the next month or so without having to refresh insanely? Maybe fellow Brits know some shops or something that we might have a better chance at finding the console.

I finally played Gears 5 while I was home sick.,"I finished Gears 5's campaign today and I justed needed to say that whether or not I go the Xbox Series X or PS5 route (still undecided) I had a blast.  

I've been with the franchise since the start. I even grew up in the city where it was developed (I had a signed copy of Gears of War 3 back home as well, from a midnight release where some developers were doing a signing at a local Gamestop).  Gears of War was the co-op shooter my friends and I played in between Halo releases. We would go through the campaign at scheduled times so no one got left behind and when we beat the story we would play endless rounds of horde and try and beat wave 50 on each map, some nights we were up until 3 am (for reference I was 17 in highschool when 3 came out).  

When Gears of War 4 came out I was excited to get back on and clear it with my friends, but unfortunately they had all grown tired of the series. So me and my younger beat it together and I stuck around for a bit of multiplayer and horde for a bit, no where near as much as 2 or 3.  It was the ultimate experience I had when I was a kid but I appreciated my brother tagging along even if he had no investment to the story or anything. 

So by the time Gears 5 came out I was hesitant to play it, since my brother now lives in a different time zone and doesn't play online as much anymore either.  I had Game pass so I downloaded it. Got in a match of horde just see how it looked and felt. Yup felt like Gears alright.  Then I played the story and stopped about halfway through the second act.  I just wasn't feeling it.  And I pretty much put it out of my mind all together. 

Then this weekend I got a mild cold and couldn't work the last few days.  I figured I could use some action and melodrama so I decided to boot up Gears 5 and sink my teeth in.

I beat it in less then a couple days but what a ride. The story was pretty good honestly, I didn't really appreciate swapping protagonists after only one game in the new trilogy but I ended up preferring Kait over JD overall, she's just something different for the series and her motivation was interesting enough to get me hooked. 

Now while I liked the story, I loved the moments of sheer spectacle.  There were times when I would drop my jaw when I certain scene would happen.  I haven't felt so tiny in a videogame since Halo 2 verses the Scarab.  And I wasn't just tiny, I was the scrappy Outsider on a mission. I was pretty immersed I'd say.  The visuals and sound design, just outstanding. 

But the gameplay, the most I've ever clicked in a Gears of War game.  Using Jack's abilities allowed me to change it up and figure out new tactics.  There were so many hairpin moments where one shot and one second decided whether or not I was going to be a splatter on the screen, and when I pulled it off, just fantastic.  Or when I was using the GL Lancer and managed to get 4-5 drones in one shot during an intense fight. So satisfying.  And that's the other thing every firefight was tense and after each one it only ramped up and up.  Oh and the boss fight in act 2, I died countless times but eventually when I overcame it I got that sigh of relief that I honestly haven't had with a game for a while.  This game made me feel like a kid again going, ""what the fuck?!"" like I did when I was in highschool with my friends. 

I didn't care too much for the open world. I liked the side objectives alright, nothing memorable, the component parts kept me checking every nook and cranny, and the skiff when it got up to speed was really fun to drive, but it felt too empty and padding to validate it being there.  You could've kept the linear level design and maybe had an optional side mission you could either ignore or do along the route and it'll bring you back to where you were, but I guess they were just following trends or something.  

I gotta say I didn't expect to write a full review like this before 10pm, but I was just surprised how much I actually enjoyed this game.  I look back on the series fondly but when I'm away from it I usually just think of it as ""The big dudes shoot at the ugly dude behind a well placed wall"" and kinda just write it off.  But when I'm actually playing it, I get it.  It is definitely just like I described but it's got more to it then I remembered and I'm glad I got this cold so I could play it.  Whether or not I stick with Xbox or not this was a good game to finish this generation on.

Why 4K-60FPS must be the new standard?,"I would make this as clear as possible, when you tell your developers their game must support 4K 60 FPS, you actually telling them to lower the graphics specs of the game. (As long as its not an indie game)

People need to understand that a game can look a lot better on 1080P 60FPS than 4k 60 FPS and even 4k 30 fps sometimes , because there are other aspects of graphics other than resolution...

I’m not sure if they have meant for this to happen, or if they’ve accidentally fucked something up whilst migrating the stores over? I can’t purchase any 360 game that’s on Game Pass either, just error messages for days. Needs to be sorted out ASAP."

Speaker Recommendations?,"Hey all, 

So, maybe not the totally best place to ask this, but I figured I'd go for it anyway. 

I have my 1X setup in my home office connected to a Samsung 4K monitor. I'm looking for suggestions on how to improve my audio quality.  If I'm playing a multiplayer game, I use an Astro A10 headset. If I'm playing offline single player games, I have a pretty basic Logitech speaker set I picked up at Best Buy several years ago. 

Keeping things simple and without breaking the bank too badly (say \~$100) what would you recommend?

Thanks!",t2_82wair0x,0,"Speaker Recommendations? Hey all,

One example would be someone like Brad Sams who is on YouTube and just drops the news and gives his thoughts on it. He is specific to Microsoft products of all kinds but I still enjoy him for his Xbox takes. Another is ReviewTechUSA who has a few videos throughout the day and then has a livestream at night where he just fields questions via chats.

Will dead space be optimized on series x/s?,,t2_5e7l4c0t,0,Will dead space be optimized on series x/s? 
"I heard a rumor that the Devs are a little more active in paying attention to the customers wants more than the PS4 devs. Is this true, and could you possibly link me to examples?","Life has pulled me from Xbox, but if this is true, I would much rather migrate my library for an even slightly improved user experience. 

(More about me and my experience. TL;DR's by the paragraph) 

**TL;DR** - Don't choose a system based off what other people have. If they actually play the same games as you, they probably don't have the time to. 

I think it's been about five years since I switched. At the time I had a bunch of co-workers and a few friends on the  PlayStation side when I decided to go with the crowed. Since then, I've spent maybe 5% of my play time playing with other PlayStation users. 


**TL;DR** -  My games aren't proprietary and people sound better muted


The overall experience has been rather bland to be honest. The community is pretty toxic in the games I play based on the majority of interactions. (If you didn't know already, I'm absolute garbage and my mother is a very social woman.) I mainly play Apex, RocketLeague, and lately I've really enjoyed Ancestors The Humankind Odyssey. Other than that the games I play really aren't exclusive to the platform. 


**TL;DR** - Entertainment apps are slow and the overall UI feels so cumbersome

The UI is as impractical today as it was the day I got the console. You can group games into folders, but you can't take certain apps out of the entertainment folder. It takes about - okay I timed it. It took exactly 54.26 seconds and 4 to 5 clicks from the home screen just to  open Netflix. NETFLIX dude. YouTube is double the clicks because it's positioned further away in the folder of ""Can't Take It Out"". This might sound ridiculous, but I've at so many cold dinners just trying to set up a movie I *want* to watch. Call me crazy, but I don't remember Xbox's home screen being so insanely difficult. 


**TL;DR** - Partying up is easily 10x harder than I remember Xbox being. 

""Starting a party? Sure! Lemme just create the room..........okay I..... I think that's it............oh wait! I gotta invite the person hah, my fault!"" - PS4

My console doesn't speak in the ""traditional sense"", but you get the idea. 


**TL;DR** - If you think you have memory, think again. 

It is entirely possible to have a significant amount of storage left that would more than cover the size of a games update, BUT apparently you have to be able to load up TWICE the amount of complete storage the game requires or something like that simply because, 
""That's how it is."" - SONY rep
This meant that in order to update Red Dead Redemption, or Call of Duty MW; I needed to have about 150-200gb free at all times. Luckily I got the terabyte console to house these games on! 
""Just buy the disc!"" That is a wonderful idea, except RDR2 *is* a disc.  
I feel cheated out of multiple titles. I didn't mention Starwars Battlefront because I got it in the free game of the month offer. 


**TL;DR** - The controller sucks ass. 


**TL;DR** - Gameplay recoding is far superior on Xbox 

I've since gotten used to this, but damn I miss remembering how much better clipping gameplay was on Xbox... Have they made improvements? Tell me about the rabbits...



Okay, I think I've said enough. There's some more I look for that I'm not getting into, but my update finally downloa- alright it still has to install. 


Here's my question to budget gamers: Do you think buying an Xbox one will still be a reasonable purchase after the new generation releases? 

And to everyone: Does any of this sound like your experience on Xbox? 

I think I remember the grass actually being pretty green over there comparatively...",t2_12mn9a,0,"I heard a rumor that the Devs are a little more active in paying attention to the customers wants more than the PS4 devs. Is this true, and could you possibly link me to examples? Life has pulled me from Xbox, but if this is true, I would much rather migrate my library for an even slightly improved user experience. 

(More about me and my experience. TL;DR's by the paragraph) 

**TL;DR** - Don't choose a system based off what other people have. If they actually play the same games as you, they probably don't have the time to. 

I think it's been about five years since I switched. At the time I had a bunch of co-workers and a few friends on the  PlayStation side when I decided to go with the crowed. Since then, I've spent maybe 5% of my play time playing with other PlayStation users. 


**TL;DR** -  My games aren't proprietary and people sound better muted


The overall experience has been rather bland to be honest. The community is pretty toxic in the games I play based on the majority of interactions. (If you didn't know already, I'm absolute garbage and my mother is a very social woman.) I mainly play Apex, RocketLeague, and lately I've really enjoyed Ancestors The Humankind Odyssey. Other than that the games I play really aren't exclusive to the platform.

Can't play Destiny 2 on same network with other Xbox,"Been tearing my hair out over this issue reading countless forum and reddit posts, trying all suggestions without success and I'm about at my limit.

Hardware:

Modem: Arris SB8200

Router: Netgear Nighthawk AC1750 (R6700v3)

Xbox One X (x2)


The problem:

My room mate and I can play together just the two of us in a fireteam for hours without issue, but if we bring a friend into the fireteam and attempt to do an activity, one of us will get booted, every time.

Some other interesting details present are:

- In the Xbox friends list, I appear offline to him even though I'm not set to Appear Offline.

- Given the above, if he sends me an invite to anything, I won't get it, but, I can send him invites, and he does get it.


What I've tried:

- Automatic IPs, UPnP enabled = can't play at all without being disconnected almost immediately with a wide assortment of Bungie error codes (beaver, eel, etc)

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled = same result

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled, + putting one Xbox in DMZ = same result

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled + IPv6 enabled = we can play without issue


At this stage, I should mention, within the Xbox Advanced Network settings, we both have Open NATs, differently assigned port numbers, and show IPv4 &amp; IPv6 in use.


Now, when we attempt playing with others in the fireteam, my NAT remains Open while the other Xbox gets a Moderate NAT (and as mentioned, one of us will get booted after starting an activity).


To try and solve this, I tried:

- Disabling UPnP, reset router, Re-enabling UPnP, reset router again, then reset modem, and both Xbox's = same issue

- Disabling UPnP, enable port forwarding for ports 88, 500, 3074, 3544, and 4500 on one system, and 89, 501, 3075, 3544, and 4501 on the other, reset everything like above = same result


This should NOT be necessary at all to get two systems working.  Almost every help topic I come across about this mentions how Bungie is a clueless pos when it comes to networking so, I'm confident it IS on their end (and maybe some of XBL too given what I mentioned about appearing offline and invites not working), but, clearly some people can make it work with all these fixes, and others make it work with no configuration at all.


Things I've not tried yet:

- Getting a 2nd IP from Comcast (from what I understand this should definitively fix the issue)

- Getting a different router


I'm not sure a 2nd IP is available to me, that's something I need to call about, but if it's not available then...

As for another router, what I'd love to know is, for those with multiple Xbox's who play Destiny 2 together without any extra configuration, what is the router that you're using?  I want it.

The load times for legacy games off a USB SSD are nearly on par with loading off the internal NVMe SSD.  It's *under a second* difference when loading Assassin's Creed Origins.   This shows that backwards compatible games don't need to be taking up valuable internal space to be played with the really quick loads.

&amp;#x200B;

Why isn't there much difference between the internal SSD and an external SSD?  It's probably because the processing of data off the drive is the real bottleneck.

"Closing in on 150,000","I currently sit at 149,644 gamer score, when I hit 100,000 I think I lined it up with either Titanfall 2 or Battlefield 1.

A story behind the new Flight Sim Japan Update trailer,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalJaTmv-TY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalJaTmv-TY)

A trailer for Flight Sim Japan Update was re-uploaded a few hours ago to celebrate its launch and to reflect some feedback regarding a political controversy.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima\_Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima_Island)

In the original video released during TGS, there was a scene with Hashima Island, a.k.a ""*Warship* Island"", a small island that were originally developed as a coal mine. During WWII, the island became a sort of 'labor camp', as Korean and Chinese civilians and prisoners were sent to the island to work at the mine under very harsh condition. 

After the initial trailer was uploaded, people immediately complained about the place being introduced as a 'beautiful scenery'. As exotic and beautiful as it may appear from the sky above, it represents a painful war memory for the survivors from the labor camp that are still alive to this day.

Microsoft told South Korean media 5 days ago that they were sorry and the trailer would be updated to remove the scene. [https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=110559](https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=110559) (a link for a Korean news article)

Xbox One Recordings: It is a case of luck,"Hi Guys,

I believe that there are dozens of posts about this but all of them suggests the same full power reset which doesn't always solve the problem.

The biggest disappointment with my current Xbox One X even with S is when you have that awesome kill, hit record, go check it later and all you have is a 6s video. The same applies to external storage which enables 1h recording.  
To try to avoid that, I always hit record like 2-4 times to make sure it will save.  


I believe I have tried everything:

* Full power reset. I always turn off/full power off the console, then turn off the wall socket - Australia power socket
* USB stick 3.0, good one
* External  Toshiba 128GB USB 3.0 mSATA  \~380MB/s
* External Silicon Power 1TB NVMe PCIe USB 3.0 storage which used to be my main storage and crazy fast loading. But the console would freak out sometimes which recently I discover it has to be an NGFF SATA so I went back to my WD 3TB USB 3.0 where all my games are stored and played from  \~480MB/s
* I've tried different USB ports from the console
* Even recording to the console which limits you to 2min, you end up with 6s videos.

I don't wanna spend thousands with captures devices, I am not a bloody YouTuber haha  
I don't wanna lose my 4K HDR TV either, the majority of the devices limit the output to 1080p

My recording setting is set to 1080p. I have even tried 720p before and still.

Is there anyone with an up to do date solution for this annoying issue?

Thanks a lot guys",t2_4d6mk7x6,0,"Xbox One Recordings: It is a case of luck Hi Guys,

I believe that there are dozens of posts about this but all of them suggests the same full power reset which doesn't always solve the problem.

The biggest disappointment with my current Xbox One X even with S is when you have that awesome kill, hit record, go check it later and all you have is a 6s video. The same applies to external storage which enables 1h recording.

Help me understand Ray Tracing (Spider-Man PS4 remastered) Honest question.," I'm not a pc gamer, so I'm not used to Ray Tracing. 

So from what I heard and know, Ray Tracing allow light to better reflects on surface and to create better reflection. (I can be wrong) 

And as you all know, today this photo of Spider-Man Ps4 remastered came to life. 

[https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv](https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv)

But I feel like there's something wrong.

With how high Peter is and that camera angle, is that normal to see all the street and the pedestrians below him? 

And also is Ray Tracing supposed to be ""like a mirror""? I mean is it supposed to have a 100% reflection of what is on the other side/angle? Is it too exaggerated in the photo or is this really what is Ray Tracing? 

I feel like this is just because it's the beggining of it on consoles so Devs doesn't have a standpoint (except on Pc)

Considering you get ultimate edition Watch Dogs 1 with the purchase Ultimate Edition for Watch Dogs Legion (Might be wrong edition) wouldn't it be cool to see an improved upon E3 graphical build of the game? It would surpass what we saw in the E3 presentation and would reignite the game and some may even consider it good after all the bug fixes and graphical upgrade. Chicago would be amazing with detailed streets and NPCs and those focus mode montages would look like a John wick movie no doubt.

This brings me to my question. With the new Gran Turismo releasing on PS5, will the current gen of periphials, (steering wheels, rudder pedals, etc.) work on a ps5? I'm really not willing to re-buy a whole new setup when truth be told, the components have no problems.

I hope Sony allows us to link our Google or Dropbox accounts on PS5 so we can make auto/manual backups. It will probably take a long time but I hope they at least consider it throughout PS5 lifecycle.

The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue.,"""Fair warning. This is going to be weirder that usual.""

So hear me out. I have been paying attention to this Yakuza issue with ps4 saves not transferring to ps5 and it seems it may not be the only game having this problem and by ommission and assumptions it's gone unnoticed.

I have to think that the issue has to be a technical one. There's no way an rpg that is crossplay wouldn't want to be cross-save as well. That makes me nervous about other games like AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk that are also crossplay.

Control got heat for only allowing the Ultimate edition to upgrade, but what if they knew the older version's saves wouldn't transfer either. Also the Spider-man remaster won't allow save transfer as well. So that's three.

I am no tech guy and this may be the concerns of an overthinker, but it bares considering that saves may not be as easy to transfer from one system to the other this time.

It could explain the new crunch time situation at CDPR after they promised they wouldn't. If they hit a snag like this they would grind their way to a solution (or they just told people what they wanted to hear).",t2_1dbv0e0c,1,"The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue. ""Fair warning.

Could we see a digital trade in option in console gaming's future?,"It's not something I expect to see with this generation, but as consumers become more and more digital I fully expect in a generation or two to see consoles go the route of Digital Only.

With that in mind, I've thought about the possibility of the PS Store some time down the line offering trade ins. You buy a game at $70, and after you've decided you won't get any use out of it you have an option to delete it from your account forever for a small credit to the PS Store of like $10 or whatever.

I hope PS5 will be available in store on launch,"PS4 on launch was a nightmare in Toronto. My brother and I traveled all around different parts of the city and it was sold out everywhere.

1440p 60fps is the way to go next gen,"Hear me out before keyboard warrioring please.

I've noticed a trend where 4K 60fps games as well as 4K 30fps games look like current gen visually(as in texture quality and the overall look of a game, not resolution). Examples of this are Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Godfall, Final Fantasy 16, Kena Bridge of spirits, Spider Man: Miles Morales and Halo Infinite. On the other hand you have very few games that genuinely look next gen. Like a handful at most. And one of these games is confirmed to run at 1440p(Demon Souls remake). Then you also have the unreal engine 5 tech demo(not a game but it still counts) which also runs at 1440p. The only other two I can think of is horizon forbidden west and black myth wukong. The former will probably be 4K 30fps knowing Sony but its going to be cross gen so a lot of power can be devoted to realistic graphics since its basically going to be an amped up version of a PS4 game. As for the latter, we do know that is 60fps and seems very unlikely to run at 4K on console judging by how advanced the graphics look compared to other next gen games. If games which look like PS4 games are bottlenecked at 4K 30 or 4K 60 there's no way in hell Black Myth Wukong can run 4K 60 so its most likely 1440p 60 like the tech demo and demon souls remake. 

Anyway, the bottom line is for a game to actually look like a genuine next gen game it has to be 1440p or sacrifice other areas like frame rate as well as being very limited in size which would be a huge turn off for some gamers such as myself who prioritise frame rate over resolution. 

1440p is a perfect compromise. 4K is a monolithic leap that is really unnecessary. Usually each gen the jump tends to be around 300p. PS1 to PS2 was 144p to 480p which is just over 300p. PS2 to PS3 was 480 to 720p which is a 240p jump. PS3 to PS4 was 720 to 1080p jump so 360p. If we go from 1080p to 1440p that would still be an above average leap at 360p difference. We all noticed the sharp resolution quality increase when we switched from 3 to 4 so why wouldn't the same happen with 1440p. 4K on the other hand is excessive. Why jump 1080 pixels all of a sudden? Not only is this uncalled for but like I said, it also sacrifices frame rate and ultimately weakens the graphical quality of games by using so much of the GPU's power so that the actual graphical quality of games look like last gen. 1440p 60fps is a much more well rounded solution that benefits everyone and is more beneficial towards both graphics and gameplay. Besides a needlessly large jump in resolution that people will get used to pretty quickly, there is nothing to lose from this.

Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013. What do you guys think how PS5 will perform throughout its life cycle?,"So this is more of a technical discussion I guess. I've been thinking a bit about the PS4 lately in an effort to understand how the PS5s life cycle may play out.

And basically three major questions have emerged:

1. was the PS4 really underpowered when it launched?

2. How come resolution and framerate didn't really get worse throughout its life cycle even as games became more visually impressive?

3. What does that mean for PS5?

I'd like to give my own two cents on this but I'm very curious to hear your takes on this since I most propably missed some stuff.

Was the PS4 underpowered? Looking back at 2013 I don't actually think it was. But the specs were certainly less impressive than PS5 today. Everyone (me included) constantly trashes PS4s CPU but at launch it was propably somewhere around Intel i3. Not too bad. The 1.84tf wasn't too bad either. Definitely not high end but still mid range. The 8gb of DDR5 on the other hand were really impressive. This was during a time when we were debating wether you needed 2gb of video RAM. All in all I'd say PS4 was a mid range system compared to PS5 which sits in the higher mid range.

So why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time? Especially during the Xbox360/PS3 era there was a clear trend towards games performing worse later in the generation. In 2006/7 you'd actually see some 720p 60fps AAA titles. Later on it was more like 540p25fps.

This didn't really happen for PS4 though and I don't really have an answer for that. At launch most PS4 games were ~900p 30fps and I can't say it has gotten much worse over time. In fact during 2015 I'd say performance actually got better with lots of games hitting 1080p30fps or 900p60fps. I don't really have an answer for this one since PS4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required years of experience to unlock its power. My guess is that games didn't get that much more demanding with PC gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals (judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example). This generation didn't really have a Crysis that completely blew away the status quo.

Now to my final question. What does that mean for PS5? While PS5 is more powerful than PS4 was back in the day I'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot.

If the life cycle does in fact turn out similarly to PS5 I think the status quo will be 4K 60fps without ray tracing and 30fps with ray tracing. However the UE5 demo from this summer tells a different story. It was super impressive but only ran at 1440p 30fps. I could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding. In that case I think it is absolutely crucial that PS5 has a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low res image to something that at least resembles 4K resolution. Otherwise I fear we will see the issue where lots of games will be ""dynamic 4K 30fps"" but will dip wayy below 4K most of the time, resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a 4K display.

What do you guys think about this? Did I miss something? Did I get something wrong? What's your take on PS4s performance throughout its life cycle and how do you anticipate PS5 will compare?",t2_5p6btf8r,1,"Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013.

The 8gb of DDR5 on the other hand were really impressive. This was during a time when we were debating wether you needed 2gb of video RAM. All in all I'd say PS4 was a mid range system compared to PS5 which sits in the higher mid range.

So why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time? Especially during the Xbox360/PS3 era there was a clear trend towards games performing worse later in the generation. In 2006/7 you'd actually see some 720p 60fps AAA titles. Later on it was more like 540p25fps.

This didn't really happen for PS4 though and I don't really have an answer for that. At launch most PS4 games were ~900p 30fps and I can't say it has gotten much worse over time. In fact during 2015 I'd say performance actually got better with lots of games hitting 1080p30fps or 900p60fps. I don't really have an answer for this one since PS4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required years of experience to unlock its power. My guess is that games didn't get that much more demanding with PC gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals (judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example). This generation didn't really have a Crysis that completely blew away the status quo.

Now to my final question. What does that mean for PS5? While PS5 is more powerful than PS4 was back in the day I'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot.

If the life cycle does in fact turn out similarly to PS5 I think the status quo will be 4K 60fps without ray tracing and 30fps with ray tracing. However the UE5 demo from this summer tells a different story. It was super impressive but only ran at 1440p 30fps. I could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding. In that case I think it is absolutely crucial that PS5 has a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low res image to something that at least resembles 4K resolution. Otherwise I fear we will see the issue where lots of games will be ""dynamic 4K 30fps"" but will dip wayy below 4K most of the time, resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a 4K display.

What do you guys think about this? Did I miss something? Did I get something wrong? What's your take on PS4s performance throughout its life cycle and how do you anticipate PS5 will compare?"

Rise Gamers! Turkish Gamers are in a very bad situation. Please help us to get regional pricing,"Hi. Let me get straight to the point. I am asking for the help of all gamers around the world so Turkish Playstation users can also enjoy the great exclusives you guys do.  
  
Playstation Turkey recently increased the prices of some games to enormous amounts. For example, the new Avengers game costs 679 Turkish liras (87 US $) or Need for Speed Heat costs 709 Turkish liras (91 US $). So with these prices, we can only buy 3 games if we save all of our monthly minimum wage (2.324 Turkish liras). Let me also add that lots of people in Turkey earn a minimum wage because there is a  lack of jobs, even people who graduate from universities could end up in a minimum wage job which is not enough for anything.   
  
Let me also add that, this economical situation of our country is of course not the problem of Sony. We are also people just like you, I may or not support this goverment but I have the right to enjoy games as much as other people from other contries do. Just because I am born in this country, should not mean that I should not enjoy the things that you guys do. Other companies help with their pricing so we can also play games but Sony does not. For example 20$ indie games cost around 32 Turkish Liras on Steam so we can also enjoy them. Another example for Steam could be Cyberpunk 2077 costing 249 turkish liras. With these pricing examples, we can afford them by saving money for a few weeks/months. Microsoft also offers us Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for 45 Turkish Liras a month so we can enjoy as much as you guys do.  
  
But when it comes to Sony, they don't do anything. I also want to enjoy the new upcoming God of War Ragnarok or the new Demon's Souls but at this rate they are going to cost 800-900 turkish liras which is far from affordable. And even worse the PS5 is probably going to cost arond 8000 Turkish Liras (1020 US$) because of the heavy taxes of our country.  
  
What I am asking from Sony is to give Turkish players a regional pricing. If they don't want this because of the abuse that other gamers from other countries can do (buying from us because its cheaper) they could make it so that only people with Turkish ID's would be able to buy from the Turkish store.  
  
And from you guys and girls, from you fellow Gamers. I am asking for your support. Please support us so we can also enjoy that new God of War game, even that cute Bugsnax game together. I don't want to be forced to wait for the hope of getting these new games on ps plus when they come to that service 4 years later.

Game boost mode for ps4 games,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

He was not talking about BC but Game boost mode for ps4 titles. 

That's a huge fucking announcement that got obscured due to not understanding what he was talking about at the time due to missing info.

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling.

PS5 checkerboard rendering?,"With Digital Foundry's recent analysis of Demons Souls indicating a 1440p/60fps rendering target, it occurred to me that I don't recall hearing (and haven't been able to uncover) anything about a native checkerboarding solution for PS5. For those unaware, the PS4 Pro had dedicated hardware to interpolate and fill in missing pixels from incomplete 4K frames using previous frames (aka ""checkerboard rendering""), giving a much better visual approximation of 4K than upscaling, but without the performance cost of native 4K.

It seemed logical that Demon's Souls could *possibly* target a CB4k/60fps display if Sony has included similar checkerboarding hardware in the PS5. A partial 1920x2160 frame (whose missing 1920 horizontal pixels could be CB'ed to complete a full 4K frame) does contain 12% more pixels than a native 1440p one (4,147,200 pixels vs 3,686,400), but that does put it at least potentially within optimization reach for Demon's Souls. I would consider this somewhat unlikely for Demon's, given that Bluepoint is on record as preferring the simpler approach of temporal injection of 1440p into a 4K framebuffer in the Shadow of the Colossus remaster. Regardless, having the option of checkerboarding on the PS5 could put higher-detail performance modes within reach of many future titles, rather than forcing a strict compromise of ""performance = 1440p, detail = 4K"".

I can see why Sony might not have drawn attention to checkerboarding with the PS5, as it would likely stoke fanboy allegations of the console being too weak for ""real 4K"" etc, but given how well it was implemented in the PS4 Pro, it's hard for me to imagine them excluding it for any reason other than the already high expense of the hardware. I know there are robust software-based checkerboarding solutions out there, and 1440p titles from last-gen like Uncharted 4 / LL and TLoU2 did really well with their overall image quality and detail. But for me the PS4 Pro really proved that checkerboarding is the best technology outside of DLSS for getting high detail at a low performance cost, and if a game could offer me CB4K/60fps vs 1440p/60fps, I'd choose the former almost every time.",t2_l34q1c0,1,"PS5 checkerboard rendering?

Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I’ve ever had. And here are my tips if you ever decide to camp out for one.,"As the title says, I’ve managed to secure a pre order at my GameStop to get my PS5, and I still can’t believe it honestly. Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it’s been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they’ll have available, if it’s okay to start a line overnight, what they’re store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don’t show up at 6AM thinking that you’re going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5’s available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don’t have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don’t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It’s going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what’s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other’s backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You’re all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who’s unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don’t be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it’ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who’s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that’s awesome, but if you don’t just make sure you don’t take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I’ll say this, I wasn’t going to go either, but something just told me “fuck it, if there aren’t any then just go back home”, but I’m telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you’ll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren’t able to secure a PS5, eventually you won’t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don’t lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can’t believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you’re local weather! Bring completely charged electronics &amp; of course wear your masks!",t2_6cu42drr,1,"Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I’ve ever had.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.


&amp;nbsp;

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",t2_civ38,1,"What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5 Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

I hope PS5 will allow us to do this.(regarding save scumming),"on PS4 if you want to back up a save to USB you have to close the game to do the back up task, that's really irritating especially when you go after 2 or more conflicting Trophies (i.e. Endings) or when forging an equipment which have RNG skills and you are looking for a specific skill on that equipment until you're running out of resources if you didn't get what you want you can go to your backed up save. i know PS5 can boot up games fast and i'll be where i left the game in few seconds after backing up my save but still doing that without shutting down the game is more convenient for us Save-Scummers.

Who here is refugee from geforce now?,"After using gfn for nearly 3 years and having virtually all of my favourite games removed from the service - I am coming to ps5 so I have more actual ownership of my games. Gfn is a great service don't get me wrong and has given me access to a lot of my old steam games (having no suitable pc) but after having virtually all my fighting games removed along with all my racing games, enough is enough. Gfn plays perfectly well and gives reasonable graphics at 1080p, but it's not without its faults. Small amounts of lag, sub par rigs for certain games - these are all problems I am looking to overcome with getting a ps5. Finally I will be able to buy a game, knowing it won't be removed, play it without lag, and enjoy 4k.

PS5's Storage...,"How do you guys feel about the storage being 825GB? Do you think with PS4 Pro having 1TB of Storage.. should the PS5 release with 1TB storage?...

Just get a replacement. I've seen a lot of people worried, waiting for next year for PS5 just because of the viral launch issues from every console.

 Chances you'll get a defective system are low *(but not impossible, obviously...)* and if you do, that's what the standard warranty is for!

If they revived an old favorite via sequel or remake for the new generation of consoles what would titles would get you genuinely excited?,"I absolutely love video games and although I would never really call myself a hard-core gamer, especially after having kids and very little time to devote to the hobby, I’ve been around long enough to have my fair share of memorable video game moments.  

The soul crushing experience of beating Ghouls &amp; Ghosts only to find it demanding a second play through to officially beat the game...  Neighborhood friends leaning on my windowsill, mouth agape when we discovered the blood code for Mortal Kombat. My little brother and I picking our jaws up off of the floor when we experienced the first few minutes of Devil May Cry on our PS2 on Christmas morning having never experienced graphics like that on a console before. The two of us huddled under our covers absolutely terrified during a 2 AM session of resident evil or silent hill.

As I mentioned before, now that I’m a dad and don’t have nearly as much time to devote to playing video games as I would like. That said, as I look back, there are a few titles that I would collectively lose my shit over and make the time to play through if they happened to find their way onto the newest generation of consoles. 

**SSX Tricky**- The original and subsequent follow ups to the series definitely did a great job showcasing the capabilities of that generation of consoles however SSX Tricky brought the beautiful graphics head to head with incredibly satisfying and completely outrageous over the top game physics while adding its own unique brand of humor, customization, and addictive leveling system, all while stringing together ridiculous over the top superhuman trick combinations not seen since the days of Tony Hawk Pro skater. 

To see this title brought to the next generation of consoles with a graphical overhaul, and dear god just imagine what could be done with the haptic feedback of the new PS5 controllers. Imagine how addictively satisfying it would feel to push off a jump and feel the snap or pop of the board or literally feeling the powder crunch underfoot after landing a ridiculously sweet combo... there’s just so much potential hear it makes me a little crazy. 

**Oddworld: Strangers Wrath** - I can’t honestly remember how I stumbled across this game but it was one that I feel didn’t quite get the praise in attention it deserved. I could be wrong about this, perhaps that was just my perception, but I was left so satisfied after playing through this title. How seamlessly they were able to blend third person  3D platformer and first person shooter was just incredible. And the fact that you could almost play through the entire game using one or the other speaks volumes. The humor laced throughout, the creativity of “live ammunition“, and with a fantastic storyline to boot, this is one of those titles that genuinely left me sad upon completion as I just simply didn’t want it to end.

**Tiger Woods circa early-mid 2000s** - Damn was this title addictive. I know they are still pumping out titles but they are just not the same. No it wasn’t a ridiculously realistic golf simulator and that’s what made it great. The injection of and well balanced mix of arcade style gameplay and simulation, incredibly satisfying and addictive swing mechanics, silly customizations, and the genuinely hilarious in game commentary from David Feherdy &amp; Gary McCord made these titles so much damn fun. Nothing since has quite been able to capture the magic this series once had. They need to ease up on the simulation and inject a hint more of the arcade style shenanigans. Bring this series back to its glory days! Hell you didn’t even have to like golf to enjoy those games. 

Wipeout - I mean come on this game is PlayStation. Nough said.

Twisted metal - “Ehem” See above.

Is anyone else hoping that the PS5 has the ability to stream and play music at the same time?,I know its a copyright issue (i think) but it would be nice if the PS5 could separate game audio and music while streaming so viewers dont hear the music. I have always wanted to stream more but its hard for me to game with my music playing. Especially while im sim racing,t2_e1ybl,1,Is anyone else hoping that the PS5 has the ability to stream and play music at the same time?

I'm Worried the PS5 UI Will Launch With a Lot of Missing Features (Similar to PS3 and PS4) Your Thoughts?,"So if you all recall, the PS3 and especially PS4 user interfaces were lacking in a lot of features upon the launch of the respective consoles. For example, both consoles got **themes and background customization support** a lot further down the road. (I always found it weird that even though themes were very much a  thing on PS3, they weren't a thing on PS4 at all until I think about a year into the console's life.

PS4, specifically, got the following features and some others that I'm probably forgetting about a number of years after the console launched: **(folders, quick menu support, online/offline appearance, etc.)**

Sony knows that all these features and more are the kinds of things we expect from the start of a generation at this point. Since they're basically ""quid pro quo"" features for any good UI nowadays. But going off of their track record, I am just concerned we'll be missing a lot of these cool features come November 12th. Keep in mind, I have no idea of the complexities of UI development and don't want to undermine the hard work I'm sure they're putting into the UI. 

I might be stressing over nothing. What do you fine folks think?",t2_9vbdy,1,"I'm Worried the PS5 UI Will Launch With a Lot of Missing Features (Similar to PS3 and PS4) Your Thoughts?
