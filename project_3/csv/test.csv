Xbox Series X seems to be outselling Playstation 5 in Brazil,"
The pre orders for XSX and XSS only started yesterday (Sep-29) in Brazil. PS5 pre orders, on the other hand, started at the same world-wide date (Sep-17) here.

After 12 days PS5s are not sold out yet in any of the top 3 national retailers. And several retailers are now giving 5-10% discounts.

So as I was cleaning out my xbox one, I accidentally broke of the connector that  the front ribbon cable connects to on the front panel board. Instead of changing out the hole front panel board, do you think I could just solder on a new connector for the ribbon cable?

The light in the xbox logo turns on when I start the concole (via the controller), but I can't seem to manually press the buttons for on/off or eject the disk. Not a big proglem, but still annoying...

Sony should capitalize on gyro-aiming this generation.,"Gyro aiming is a way of minimizing the precision gap between controllers versus mouse&amp;keyboard. The use of gyro aiming doesn't replace the the right analog stick, but instead is used merely for fine-tuning. For those unfamiliar, here are a few videos illustrating in different ways its surprising potential for shooter games:

————

[\[Halo with gyro aiming\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqaz6SxnwnI&amp;t=1s)

[\[Linus Tech Tips\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qlZmXnE1mw)

[\[Motion Controls and the Rejection of Progress\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=binPB4YbWmM&amp;ab_channel=Nerrel)

————

 Unfortunately, gyro aiming is often misunderstood. Here are common arguments I see against it, and why they aren't compelling:

**I wouldn't use it.** That's fine. But others would like to, and making it optional can leave everyone happy.

**It shouldn't be mandatory.** To my knowledge, no shooter has ever made gyro aiming mandatory.

**It would be expensive.** Gyro sensors are relatively inexpensive and wouldn't require any novel technology.

**It hinders accessibility.** More options increases accessibility.

**It's a gimmick.** Gyro aiming requires minimal movement and provides enhanced precision, unlike certain previous implementations of motion controls that have rightly been regarded as gimmicky.

**Not enough people care about it.** That's quickly changing as more and more people come to realize its potential.

————

On the other hand, there are good arguments in favor of gyro aiming. Most importantly, joysticks are intrinsically limited for aiming; gyro aiming enables a finer degree of precision. This

* fine-tunes the controls.
* enhances player agency.
* raises the skill ceiling without necessarily raising the skill floor.
* reduces the need to rely on auto-aim as a crutch.

————

One of the significant but underappreciated differences between the PS5 and XBX is that the PS5's controller enables gyro-aiming while the XBX's controller does not. However, there's been little effort by Sony to capitalize on this advantage. This is nothing new—the PS4 controller has a gyro sensor, but gyro aiming often wasn't even implemented in PS4's first-person shooters. This strikes me as a missed opportunity.

If you agree, I suggest reaching out to Sony via social media. The technology is already there—it's just up to Sony to take advantage of it.",t2_gxwjj,1,"Sony should capitalize on gyro-aiming this generation.

**It hinders accessibility.** More options increases accessibility.

**It's a gimmick.** Gyro aiming requires minimal movement and provides enhanced precision, unlike certain previous implementations of motion controls that have rightly been regarded as gimmicky.

**Not enough people care about it.** That's quickly changing as more and more people come to realize its potential.

On the other hand, there are good arguments in favor of gyro aiming. Most importantly, joysticks are intrinsically limited for aiming; gyro aiming enables a finer degree of precision. This

* fine-tunes the controls.
* enhances player agency.
* raises the skill ceiling without necessarily raising the skill floor.
* reduces the need to rely on auto-aim as a crutch.

One of the significant but underappreciated differences between the PS5 and XBX is that the PS5's controller enables gyro-aiming while the XBX's controller does not. However, there's been little effort by Sony to capitalize on this advantage. This is nothing new—the PS4 controller has a gyro sensor, but gyro aiming often wasn't even implemented in PS4's first-person shooters. This strikes me as a missed opportunity.

If you agree, I suggest reaching out to Sony via social media. The technology is already there—it's just up to Sony to take advantage of it."

(Unpopular Opinion?) There is absolutely not a lack of content or information coming from Sony,"First let me say that I've enjoyed hanging out on this subreddit during the build up to PS5 and I've seen some really great posts on here, in fact I changed from a long time lurker to poster because of this sub!

I must say however that recently (especially the last week), I've seen several people commenting that there's nothing coming from Sony and they're getting frustrated with the lack of info.

I'm not sure if its because I'm an older gamer (started on snes for reference lol) but this comes across as such impatience to me when I see it. Am I the only one still riding the hype from the showcase that was exactly 2 weeks ago? 

Not to mention the continuous blog posts giving more tid bits. Sure they've not shown the UI but what they have shown me is great looking games that I cant wait to play.

And you know what? I had no idea what the UI on any console I've ever owned would look like before I switched it on and I honestly think it adds to the wonder of using your shiny new console for the very first time. Surpises can be great!
