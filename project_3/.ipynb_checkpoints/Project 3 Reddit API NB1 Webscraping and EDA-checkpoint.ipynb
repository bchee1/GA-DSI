    "This data science project aims to produce a list of keywords that is of interest to digital marketing teams for the Sony Playstation (TM) 5. By scraping relevant subreddit forums, a digital marketer would be able to measure the amount of interest generated by their product launch teasers, as well as key distinguishing features between the PS5 and its most comparable competition, the Xbox Series X. Both are slated to be released in Q4 of 2020, during the annual Black Friday period. A successful NLP model would have a high accuracy and high ROC-AUC score vs the baseline."
