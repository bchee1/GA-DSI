# Project 3: Natural Language Processing and Classification

## Problem Statement

This data science project aims to produce a list of keywords that is of interest to digital marketing teams for the Sony Playstation (TM) 5. By scraping relevant subreddit forums, a digital marketer would be able to measure the amount of interest generated by their product launch teasers, as well as key distinguishing features between the PS5 and its most comparable competition, the Xbox Series X. Both are slated to be released in Q4 of 2020, around the Black Friday period. 

## Executive Summary

This project sets out to propose a classification modeling approach that would most accurately enable the data scientists at Reddit.com to predict which subreddit a post belongs to, using only the title and post data with subreddit names removed. 

Our chosen subreddits to compare are:

- r/ps5
- r/xboxone

The following sections are supported by the respective numbered Jupyter Notebooks.

1. API and EDA

Reddit posts were scraped using reddit's native API, which returns .json dictionaries for data requests. These were parsed into post and title content and saved to csv using a Pandas DataFrame.

EDA included removing null values, as well as tokenizing using Regex to remove punctuation, url components, and HTML formatted character codes. For modeling rigor, literal subreddit name references were also removed, though individual words were left in.

2. Pre-Processing

Pre-processing includes stemming, lemmatizing, and vectorizing with Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF to enhance modeling response. Data was split into train and test portions,

3. Model Selection

Using a GridSearchCV hyperparameter optimization, we selected 4 models to build and examine:

- Multinomial Naive-Bayes
- Random Forest
- K Nearest Neighbours
- Logistic Regression

4. Model Optimization

By iterating through individual GridSearches for each model, we can use trial and error to manually optimize our hyperparameters. We use a Pipeline to batch our pre-processing and model fitting into a single process, which GridSearch can iterate through. Our optimized settings for each model are built into our final models.

5. Model Evaluation

We ran each model against its Train/Test data to assess its accuracy score, and we then pulled additional new Reddit data from each sub for testing.

## Key FIndings
### Optimized Model Features

### Model 1: Multinomial Naive-Bayes

- Lemmatizer
- CountVectorizer
    - stop_words='english'
    - ngram_range=(1,1)
- GridSearch
    - cv__max_features=3490
    - mnb__alpha=1.05

### Model 2: Random Forest

- Lemmatizer
- CountVectorizer
    - stop_words='english'
    - ngram_range=(1,1)
- GridSearch
    - tf__max_features=None
    - rf__criterion='gini'
    - rf__n_estimators=93
    - rf__max_depth=8

### Model 3: KNN

- Lemmatizer
- CountVectorizer
    - stop_words='english'
    - ngram_range=(1,1)
- GridSearch
    - cv__max_features=None
    - n_neighbours=3

### Model 4: Logistic Regression

- Lemmatizer
- CountVectorizer
    - stop_words='english'
    - ngram_range=(1,1)
- GridSearch
    - cv__max_features=1700
    - lr__C=1.44
    
The respective scores are shown below as well:

|Model|Test-accuracy|ROC AUC score|
|---|---|---|
|Multinomial Naive-Bayes|0.91|0.97|
|Random Forest|0.81|0.97|
|KNN|0.67|0.71|
|Logistic Regression|0.87|0.93|

The best performing model is model 1, the Multinomial Naive-Bayes model.

## Data interpretation:

Looking specifically at the list of features from the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, we see words strongly pointing towards the Playstation line, such as PS4, PS5, and Playstation. However, these are generally considered trivial, since they already point to Sony's own products.

More interesting is the 2nd set of words which pertain to game names. These are namely: Marvel, spider, man, demon, and soul. These words refer very much to 2 Playstation exclusive game series:

- [Spider-man Remastered](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/09/30/marvels-spider-man-remastered-detailed/)
- [Demon Souls](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/demons-souls/)

These show that potential buyers for the Playstation are very much interested in the games that are exclusively produced for PS5. It is a strong signal for Sony's marketing team that the strategy to collaborate with game studios to produce titles only for Playstation is an effective strategy

Moreover, since the subreddit is already self-selecting potential buyers, it may make sense to drive PS5 sales by marketing through Reddit. This can take the form of game teasers for those PS5 exclusive games in the week leading up to Black Friday. Adwords on Reddit or Google itself can also be a focus for the digital marketing spend in the period leading up to the product launch in November.

## Project Extension: PC gaming

A plausible project extension would be to compare the sentiment key words to gaming on PCs, which itself has a large following on reddit as well. 2 of the potential subreddits are r/pcgaming, as well as r/pcmasterrace. Both sport an impressive post rate each day, a reflection of they large following.
