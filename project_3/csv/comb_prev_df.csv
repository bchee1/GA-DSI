XSX is the most quiet Xbox ever,"""I'll conclude this preview with the best news to come out of this venting weirdness: Series X, so far, is the quietest Xbox I've ever tested. Back-compat software runs the Series X to a high enough level to activate the fans and unleash noticeable heat dissipation, but I can barely hear it, even while spending hours in current-gen, open-world romps like Destiny 2 and Red Dead Redemption 2. Will that change when we get higher-performing ""next-gen"" games to test? That question, and many more, will have to wait until next time.""

Took the plunge and upgraded my One X to a 2TB SSD,"I have no regrets! It is snappy and fast now!

I used this video as a general guide: https://youtu.be/PtdDjiU_mCU

I formatted my Crucial 2TB SATA SSD with this script: https://gbatemp.net/download/xbox-one-windows-and-linux-internal-hard-drive-partitioning-script.34239/

Make sure you have multiple small sizes of TORX bits available. My iFixit kit didn‚Äôt have the tiny one I needed for 2 screws inside the case so I had to use my TORX keys from my bike kit. Otherwise, all the TORX screws are the same size bit (I‚Äôd image that‚Äôs the same for the One S). You‚Äôll also need an 8GB or larger flash drive to plug into the console to install the system files.

Is the Alien Vs. Predator Multiplayer Dead?,"Hey guys,

Back in, like, 2013, I used to play AVP CONSTANTLY. I love the multiplayer for that game, being as fun and unique as it is. Does anyone here know if the game's multiplayer scene is dead? I remember it used to take 30 minutes to fill a lobby back in 2013, so I can only imagine that it must be pretty dusty.

Any heads up would be greatly appreciated!

Stream PC games to XBox One?,"Does anyone know if there is a way to stream PC games to an XBox?

Any chance they will let that app back on their app store?  Is there another way to go about this?

"With Xbox/Microsoft now owning Bethesda I strongly believe they should pull the Skyblivion crew into actual business, give them support they need and then launch Skyblivion as an official remaster of Oblivion.","I know this idea might rub some people the wrong way, and you could technically make the argument that it's an ""add-on mod"" for Skyrim right now, but my point is for years I've watched the small crew of Skyblivion devs work their magic and truly give Oblivion a much needed and appreciated make-over.

I think now that Xbox has Bethesda, they should look at what the Skyblivion guys are doing, draw them into the fold as part of Bethesda officially, but let them continue doing what they want and then re-launch Oblivion as a remaster using what they've done.

Obviously I am not talking about just taking their work. I mean bring them into the fold as a dev team doing this Oblivion update *on the side* to the rest of Bethesda. 

To me, it's a no-brainer. Bethesda has already re-done Skyrim a few times, but why not bring in the Skyblivion people and let them do Oblivion *officially* now, giving them the money and resources to pull it all off, definitively?

TES:VI is probably 4-5 years away at least. In the meantime, we already have the Skyblivion people doing wonderful things to Oblivion, so launching it as the ""official"" Oblivion remaster in the meantime would actually be an amazing idea to hold people over until TES:VI and one thing's for sure a official Oblivion ""remaster"" in the meantime as an exclusive would help establish the Elder Scrolls series as Xbox's now-current crown jewel.

Pre-ordered Series X after nearly 10y out of the MS camp - couldn't be more excited!,"I've spent most of my high school on the 360 and I've loved the thing to death even though it was a refurbished unit. Then life happened, college, work, etc.

Fiance and I decided to double-down and invest into a Series X due to its sheer power and Game Pass. I can already see myself revisiting 360 classics and catching up on XBO games I passed on.

Do you think Best Buy will reserve/honor a console for those who signed up All-Access like Gamestop and MS?,"Hi everyone, I've just joined this sub and I'm super excited for the Series S and X to drop this fall! I can't wait to be back in the xbox family (hopefully) soon.

I have a question that's similar to what I'm sure a lot of other people have had, and I've been hoping to get some sort of update but I can't get a reliable answer from either Citizens One, Microsoft, or Best Buy. I tried to preorder the Series S through Best Buy last week, and I was able to get all my info in for All-Access, but I was kicked out of process before I could successfully order a console. Now, I have an approved line of credit from Citizens One with nothing to use it on, and no idea how I would go about applying it if and when pre-orders come back before launch (I'm guessing we could use the account number?). 

I know MS and Gamestop have realized the predicament this puts a lot of people who signed up for all-access in, and they've reached out to customers, but Best Buy (and I believe also Wal-Mart, unless I missed an update), have been silent on the issue so far. With that in mind, I was wondering if you guys had heard anything from Best Buy, or if right now my only course of action is just to hope I can secure a console before my line of credit is closed from inactivity.

Looking for RPGs with good writing and a blankish-slate main character,"I like well-written RPGs with a protagonist whose name and backstory aren't pre-determined. I'm willing to allow *some* leeway on that. The KOTOR games, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Dragon Age: Origins and Inquisition give your character a vague backstory, but you can sort of play around that. You aren't locked into a particular role.

I also prefer a darker tone to a goofy one. The more roleplaying opportunity, the better.

Aside from the games mentioned above, here are some other games that I have really enjoyed that fit what I'm looking for in some way or another:

The Baldur's Gate Saga

Pathfinder: Kingmaker

Pillars of Eternity

Neverwinter Nights

Obviously I'm open to games with different playing styles, but I tend really not to like the arcade/MMORPG style of Inquisition, even though I thought it had a great story. For the best combo of writing and gameplay, I would take the writing of F:NV and the gameplay of FO4, although I think that the writing of FO4 is still pretty good. 

One game I'm considering is The Outer Worlds. It looks like it may be a tad goofier than I am normally attracted to, but if it's well-written, fun to play, and allows for some good roleplaying, then I'm open to giving it a chance. Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps popping up, but the story doesn't sound all that interesting to me. But who knows.

Controller is sent in for repairs. Can't use KBM without logging in with a controller first?,"So my warranty was almost up for my razer wolverine controller and it had a few issues that hugged me so I sent it back. Got about 2 weeks before my new one arrives and I thought this would be fine as xbox has a great selection of keyboard and mouse available games but there's a catch. You CANNOT log on to many of these games without a single input from a controller. A simple press of A is all you need then you can go about your merry keyboard and mouse adventures. So here I am with a  plethora of fully functioning devices and no ability to actually play.

So my warranty was almost up for my razer wolverine controller and it had a few issues that hugged me so I sent it back. Got about 2 weeks before my new one arrives and I thought this would be fine as xbox has a great selection of keyboard and mouse available games but there's a catch. You CANNOT log on to many of these games without a single input from a controller. A simple press of A is all you need then you can go about your merry keyboard and mouse adventures.

Xbox One Seattle Skyline Controller with matching charging stand,"Hey All, I received this controller a few months back from an MS rep. It has never been used, as I use my Elite controller.

Will there ever be a *true* Xbox handheld?,"I know that some people may have mentioned this before but I just want to say it.

You know what grinds my gear? The super tiny text in xbox one games.,"\*Start old man rant\* I got my xbox one s about a year ago, and one thing i noticed right away was how small the text is in the games. It is like these games were designed for you to sit 3 feet in front of your tv.

My living room layout, I have a 40"" 1080p tv, and I sit about 15 feet away on the sofa. Last generation games everything was fine, text was legible, graphics were good. Got a xbox one s, and now i have to sit 5 feet in front of the screen on the floor to be able to read the stats and status messages on the screen. 

Maybe my eyes are getting worse, or games are getting too text heavy that they need to cram a ton of text on the screen at once. I constantly have to tell my daughter not to sit so close to the screen. 

I have game pass, so I tried lots of games. Any game with stats and numbers, are super tiny. I enjoy ubisoft games, so maybe it is mostly ubisoft (watchdogs1,2, assassins creed, the division 1,2)

XBOX fan and UI/UX Designer here,"Why the new XBOX STORE look so cheap and feel laggy as hell ? Navigation is awful, transition between games feel just broken, The global rectangular design is not respected and there is no logic in navigation.

I do not understand any changes made. When I look for a game among the deals for example, I only see 6 at a time, and everything is even slower than before.

Dumb Xbox One / One X / Series X / Series S backwards compatibility questions...,"I can't find any articles that explain this simply, so I'm asking here.

The Series S is just a shittier Series X, like a PC with a cheaper graphics card? 

Both Series S and Series X come in a disc or discless version?

Can't add your own hard drive X/S, have to use proprietary MS hard drive add on? 

The Series S and Series X maintain the same backwards compatibility with Xbox and 360 games that the Xbox One had and is 100% completely backwards compatible with every One game except Kinect games? 

The Xbox One X (but not the original Xbox One?) is forwards compatible with many (all?) Series X/S games? They just run at lower resolutions and reduced graphics.

I thought of an idea for Microsoft/Playstation so physical games could be still relevant in the future,"Why not adapt the serial key design that PC uses on software in the past? The disc is used to install the game on the hardware and requires a serial key to activate on your account. The game converts into a digital game and the disc is no longer needed to play the game.

Applying the serial key is automatic as well. It's as easy as putting the disc in and it will ask the user if they want to tether this license to this account. 

If you want to lend a game to your friend, all your friend needs to do is to put that same disc into his console and will notify him that it's registered to another user and will deactivate the previous owner's copy and apply the license to him instead.

However; This method would probably involve an internet connection for physical games to be played and installed for the first time. Also ""legacy games"" aka xbox 360/xbox one disc games probably won't be able to implement such a feature.

It might be too late now but perhaps in the future?

"If you have a Xbox One X, you might want to hold off on upgrading to the Series X for about a year. Here's why:","Don't downvote me into oblivion just yet. Hear me out.

I'm *not* saying don't get the Series X. I currently have a One X and already have my pre-order for the Series X, after all. 

However, if you already have an Xbox One X like me, it might not be the upgrade you were expecting... yet.

Here's why:

- Only the newest TV's with HDMI 2.1 can take full advantage of the power of the Series X to display 4K at **120 fps** (and output uncompressed Dolby Atmos audio). The *vast* majority of people with 4K TVs still have HDMI 2.0, which is limited to 4K at **60 fps** (and can't output uncompressed Dolby Atmos audio).

- However, there's very little reason to upgrade your TV to HDMI 2.1, because Aaron Greenburg said that 4K @ **60fps** will be the [""standard output""](https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x-features-60-fps-standard-output-confirms-xboxs-aaron-greenberg#:~:text=Today%2C%20Xbox's%20Aaron%20Greenberg%20said,appear%20to%20be%20the%20case.) on the Series X.

**The Xbox One X and current HDMI 2.0 TVs can *already* do that.**

- The biggest reason I wanted to upgrade to the Series X immediately was to play next gen games with ray tracing. However, Halo Infinite wasn't going to launch with ray tracing (hopefully it will after the indefinite delay?), and neither will Valhalla or Cyberpunk. Ray tracing on big titles doesn't seem to be coming until next year, at the earliest.

So, even if you have the latest 4K TV with HDMI 2.1, you'll still just be playing ""next gen"" games at 4K 60fps, with no ray tracing, which **the Xbox One X is already capable of doing right now**.

New games will release on the current generation for the foreseeable future, and Smart Delivery makes upgrading *immediately* even less necessary.

So, the only remaining advantages of upgrading from the One X to the Series X *right now* are:

- Faster loading times
- More *stable* 60fps framerate 
- Quick resume
- Faster UI?

If you have an original Xbox One or Xbox One S, the Series X is a huge upgrade immediately.

However, if you have a Xbox One X, you might want to wait until the big titles are enhanced with ray tracing next year, the price drops, and you don't have to fight the crowds.

EDIT: Others have brought up that your One X will inevitably lose value if you wait to sell it or trade it in, so that's another factor to consider, as well. However, prices on next gen consoles will likely drop next year, especially Black Friday sales, so it might be a wash.",t2_b6lw9,0,"If you have a Xbox One X, you might want to hold off on upgrading to the Series X for about a year.

"Microsoft played a great move by buying ZeniMax Media but they could change the landscape forever by doing one simple thing. I‚Äôm surprised they‚Äôve not talked about it. Timing is crucial. Do it ASAP, Microsoft.","Why has Phil Spencer / Todd Howard / Pete better yet Microsoft or ZeniMax not even hinted at this yet? 

MODDING! CREATION CLUB! utilise it! I‚Äôm over the moon about this deal it‚Äôs nothing but good news, but I feel Microsoft are just not realising something here as if I was them I‚Äôd get to work on announcing it ASAP.  

Microsoft now essentially own the rights to these excellent franchises, timeless classics that people still play to this day (Elder Scrolls Skyrim / Fallout 4) now these were the first titles to receive mod support on console.  Which is great it‚Äôs a excellent baby step.  But then came along Creation Club okay initially a step backwards but let‚Äôs not underestimate its usage here, it provides more income towards the studios and at the same time gives its users more content with the excellent benefit of being graded content that lets you expand your game whilst also STILL enabling ACHIEVEMENTS.  

So a lot of people and I know a lot of people do this, they get one of these games, buy creation club content, love it for adding to the game, and once they get 1000g, they get the real reward which is actual mods, that completely change the game to something new. BUT that‚Äôs after they‚Äôve done everything so by then they usually drop it for PC which is just unfetted access to brilliant content, nice.  

However it‚Äôs been years since these were created and the flak has settled down, and a lot of people do not want to play on PC and not get achievements on Xbox they don‚Äôt care about steam achievements, they care about their progression on Xbox, we‚Äôre their main characters are.  Tons of people.  Some people also just have preferences.  

There is DLC that has come or is coming to PC which is just insane! sheer insanity and the work gone into these things are beyond crazy.  Why is Microsoft not helping the devs ship these ideas to console? unifying it all for PC / Xbox ? do it now! it‚Äôs insane.  Here are some examples. 

Fallout 4: 

Fallout: Miami 
- Trailer:  https://youtu.be/aPtAjvtJhf8

Apologise for the lack of fallout 4 examples I personally don‚Äôt mod it much because I prefer to play it on Xbox and I currently don‚Äôt have 1000g on it.  


Elder Scrolls Skyrim: 
- Familar Faces (amazing mod) it lets you do new game plus but your old characters are characters in your new play through. 

- Beyond Skyrim: (creating all of Tamriel within Skyrim) 
Example: https://youtu.be/oCRWN2Emgbw 

- Skyblivion: 
https://youtu.be/68uUeZGppXw

- Ordinator (essentially a adds massive amounts of skill tree perks (I think it‚Äôs over 500 new skills). 

I have played a lot of these on PC tons of them I‚Äôve even missed out hundreds more I‚Äôm just listing some examples.  But now Microsoft own both ends of the pipeline, come on and do something already.  I love modding on my PC but I also get bored when I know my progress isn‚Äôt really going forward on the system I game mainly on which is Xbox and the choice would be lovely to have, I‚Äôd even pay for these mods and wished their was creation club versions to support both Microsoft and the creators/modders.  The option should exist and now there is no excuse, none and it benefits everyone involved.  Yes these are old games, but game pass is the perfect platform to grow this still.  Let‚Äôs be honest TES6 is years away, this is the perfect time to get this going.  (I play Skyrim special edition to this day on Xbox STILL) so do my friends.  Not everyone wants to HAVE to use a PC and a load order download to do this.  People also want their progress and achievements earn able with mods on, so certify these mods, charge me I don‚Äôt care just do it.  And those opposed to creation club, well you can‚Äôt complain since these would be free in the mods list anyway or you have PC.  There is nothing wrong with choice.  

Creation Club content is spares, short and usually expensive, there is no trying to pretend it‚Äôs not, but it gives us the ability to get achievements and it works with the game giving it an authentic certified feel.  So why has the content just forzen to a halt? it‚Äôs discounted a lot which is nice, but if Microsoft allowed or begun the process of getting the back log of thousands of mods onto it, surely this would lower the cost over time since there would be enough content there to of course offset such things, and why is the space for these mods so short?.  

It‚Äôs awful that this hasn‚Äôt been requested or talked about much and the potential to have an strong instant effect that is positive for both PC users and Xbox users right now is there.  Yet I feel Microsoft will just sit on it and do nothing.  

You know what else this would do? show up Sony and how their policies are kinda of bad in this day and age, it would also give a lot of people reasons to stick with Xbox/PC and game pass, it‚Äôs on equal footing than even letting PlayStation have access to TES6.  PlayStation users could have TES6 but if modding / creation club and all these amazing ideas were made ‚Äúofficial‚Äù that would mean a lot more to many many people and having TES6 on PlayStation wouldn‚Äôt mean a thing in contrast because the real experience is on Xbox/ PC (it‚Äôs already on PC).  

So what I‚Äôm trying to say is WE as a community need to get the ball rolling, spread the word and more done, we need a dialogue with Microsoft to let them know how important this is.  Because I‚Äôm pretty sick of having to use PC for this, I want it official I want to have choice and I don‚Äôt care how.  I want my Bethesda games to last me a lot longer and surprise me everyday whilst I can get achievements and progress.  We need to hear what Microsoft thinks because no real roadblock is in the way now.  It should be a thing.   I just don‚Äôt see much mentioned since the deal has gone down.  I‚Äôd expect it to be high priority.   

Anyway, I‚Äôm just pretty sick of hoping.  I want information and i imagine so many others do too.

Are Xbox Pivoting Away From Achievements/Gamerscore?,"Over the last few software updates, both on the console (removing achievements tab), and on the android/iOS apps (no reference to achievements and gamerscore at all) it seems Microsoft is pivoting away from them.

Blocked scenes when streaming FF7,"So, the past few months (I procrastinate, don't judge me) I've been streaming the original Final Fantasy VII for a friend, as I have never played it and wanted to understand the story before hopping into the remake, as I've been told by them that it already has several changes to the plot and relies on you knowing the original.

Issue with the Xbox App on PC - Games downloading twice,"TBH I have no idea if this is the correct place to post this, but anyway...

All the previous times I formatted my computer, I downloaded Sea of Thieves and Forza through the Windows Store, and they always worked fine. This time I saw that the (latest) Xbox App also had an option to download the games, and tried downloading through there.

Now for the issue... While the Xbox app downloaded both games (and all dlc) to the correct drive, the next time I opened the windows store I saw it was trying to download the same game I had just installed (and all dlc) to my main windows drive again.  After stopping the second download, it seems the Windows Store didn't try to redownload it again, and the first download of both games are working fine.

Did anyone else had similar issues downloading games through the Xbox App, and is there a way to prevent it from doing that?",t2_glsll,0,"Issue with the Xbox App on PC - Games downloading twice TBH I have no idea if this is the correct place to post this, but anyway...

Xbox elite series 2 vs Scuf,"ok so. theres a million videos about this out there. Every single one of them come to different conclusions.

My ¬£25/$32 Cyberpunk Controller,"**tldr: I now have a fully functional Cyberpunk 2077 controller for a total of ¬£25/$31 by fixing a faulty one I bought.**

So I‚Äôve been meaning to get a spare Xbox controller for quite a while, I currently only have the one that came with my Cyberpunk Xbox One X. I have never opened one of these up but I love tinkering so I was looking for cheap faulty controllers with the intention of getting one with some joystick drift and trying to fix it. My eBay search resulted in a ‚Äúfaulty‚Äù Cyberpunk controller auction. 

The description only said ‚ÄúCondition is for parts or not working.‚Äù so I decided to chance it. I figured since it‚Äôs currently sold out and retailing on amazon for ¬£84/$99 (Is anyone actually paying this for them? Insanity!) I could pay about ¬£30/$38 and still afford a second-hand parts controller that might be in poor condition (do a shell swap) and come in under what a new controller would cost me. 

Surprisingly I ended up winning the auction for just over ¬£21/$26 and when it arrived, these were my initial observations:

1. Something is rattling around inside the case, but not every time I shook the controller(?).
2. LB kept getting stuck.
3. Visually the controller looked new/ in really good shape.

I plugged it in and here‚Äôs what I got after using this awesome little controller tester I saw TronicsFix use ‚ÄúGamepad Tester‚Äù [https://gamepad-tester.com/](https://gamepad-tester.com/) 

You can see the initial test here I screen recorded it to show some friends - [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgzeZwNAO1I**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgzeZwNAO1I) 

Here were my observations:

1. Once you clicked LB it became stuck.
2. RT was completely unresponsive.
3. Everything else was really responsive and worked well.

What surprised me was just how well everything else worked - the joysticks were very responsive as you can see in the video. 

I opened the controller up and very quickly saw what the issues were. The thing rattling around was a magnet that was meant to be in the RT assembly - it kept getting stuck on the main rumble motor which explains why it only rattled sometimes. 

The magnet casing was completely snapped off on the right side, explaining why there was no sign of life in RT and the LB issue was due to the left-hand side assembly being broken too but this time at the hinge.

Left side break (better photo below) - [https://imgur.com/8Qp2PN1](https://imgur.com/8Qp2PN1)

Speculation time. I am assuming this was just a case of rage gone wrong - right? **\*maybe\*** it just fell, but I think it‚Äôs far more likely that the previous owner raged - What do you think?

It took me a few minutes to find the right part. I tried googling for xbox trigger frames and trigger assembly and got nothing but what ended up showing actual results was ‚Äútrigger holder‚Äù - go figure! Quick note if you‚Äôre doing your own repair, double-check what controller you have because I almost ordered the older style controller version.

I had the option of either going with a part from AliExpress or eBay, but the total cost (shipment included) only differed by ¬£1/$1.3 on eBay AND I didn‚Äôt have to wait a month of delivery. If I had a repair shop I‚Äôd absolutely go with AliExpress and make a bulk order but for a one off? eBay made more sense. Plus it was only ¬£4/$5 including shipping.

Left side new and old comparison - [https://imgur.com/FkjIbGw](https://imgur.com/FkjIbGw) 

The actual repair was easier than I thought, after figuring out what the best way of getting the pin out that was holding the assembly together it was a fairly easy process: Remove pin **&gt;** Pick up the spring and the pin &gt; move over the magnet into the new holder &gt; align it into the controller &gt; pop the pin in partially &gt; put the spring in place &gt; push the pin in all the way &gt; put the rumble motor on &gt; place the trigger cap on &gt; screw it in.

I‚Äôm actually a little disappointed it all went as smoothly as it did but this was so much fun I‚Äôm actually looking for a new controller project as we speak!

Hope you enjoyed reading this, I sure had a lot of fun diagnosing it and getting it functional again.

Speculation time. I am assuming this was just a case of rage gone wrong - right? **\*maybe\*** it just fell, but I think it‚Äôs far more likely that the previous owner raged - What do you think?

It took me a few minutes to find the right part. I tried googling for xbox trigger frames and trigger assembly and got nothing but what ended up showing actual results was ‚Äútrigger holder‚Äù - go figure! Quick note if you‚Äôre doing your own repair, double-check what controller you have because I almost ordered the older style controller version.

I had the option of either going with a part from AliExpress or eBay, but the total cost (shipment included) only differed by ¬£1/$1.3 on eBay AND I didn‚Äôt have to wait a month of delivery. If I had a repair shop I‚Äôd absolutely go with AliExpress and make a bulk order but for a one off? eBay made more sense. Plus it was only ¬£4/$5 including shipping.

Left side new and old comparison - [https://imgur.com/FkjIbGw](https://imgur.com/FkjIbGw) 

The actual repair was easier than I thought, after figuring out what the best way of getting the pin out that was holding the assembly together it was a fairly easy process: Remove pin **&gt;** Pick up the spring and the pin &gt; move over the magnet into the new holder &gt; align it into the controller &gt; pop the pin in partially &gt; put the spring in place &gt; push the pin in all the way &gt; put the rumble motor on &gt; place the trigger cap on &gt; screw it in.

I‚Äôm actually a little disappointed it all went as smoothly as it did but this was so much fun I‚Äôm actually looking for a new controller project as we speak!

Hope you enjoyed reading this, I sure had a lot of fun diagnosing it and getting it functional again.

Game boost mode for ps4 games,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling. Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds.

PS5 checkerboard rendering?,"With Digital Foundry's recent analysis of Demons Souls indicating a 1440p/60fps rendering target, it occurred to me that I don't recall hearing (and haven't been able to uncover) anything about a native checkerboarding solution for PS5. For those unaware, the PS4 Pro had dedicated hardware to interpolate and fill in missing pixels from incomplete 4K frames using previous frames (aka ""checkerboard rendering""), giving a much better visual approximation of 4K than upscaling, but without the performance cost of native 4K.

It seemed logical that Demon's Souls could *possibly* target a CB4k/60fps display if Sony has included similar checkerboarding hardware in the PS5. A partial 1920x2160 frame (whose missing 1920 horizontal pixels could be CB'ed to complete a full 4K frame) does contain 12% more pixels than a native 1440p one (4,147,200 pixels vs 3,686,400), but that does put it at least potentially within optimization reach for Demon's Souls. I would consider this somewhat unlikely for Demon's, given that Bluepoint is on record as preferring the simpler approach of temporal injection of 1440p into a 4K framebuffer in the Shadow of the Colossus remaster. Regardless, having the option of checkerboarding on the PS5 could put higher-detail performance modes within reach of many future titles, rather than forcing a strict compromise of ""performance = 1440p, detail = 4K"".

I can see why Sony might not have drawn attention to checkerboarding with the PS5, as it would likely stoke fanboy allegations of the console being too weak for ""real 4K"" etc, but given how well it was implemented in the PS4 Pro, it's hard for me to imagine them excluding it for any reason other than the already high expense of the hardware. I know there are robust software-based checkerboarding solutions out there, and 1440p titles from last-gen like Uncharted 4 / LL and TLoU2 did really well with their overall image quality and detail. But for me the PS4 Pro really proved that checkerboarding is the best technology outside of DLSS for getting high detail at a low performance cost, and if a game could offer me CB4K/60fps vs 1440p/60fps, I'd choose the former almost every time.",t2_l34q1c0,1,"PS5 checkerboard rendering?

Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I‚Äôve ever had. And here are my tips if you ever decide to camp out for one.,"As the title says, I‚Äôve managed to secure a pre order at my GameStop to get my PS5, and I still can‚Äôt believe it honestly. Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it‚Äôs been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they‚Äôll have available, if it‚Äôs okay to start a line overnight, what they‚Äôre store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don‚Äôt show up at 6AM thinking that you‚Äôre going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5‚Äôs available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don‚Äôt have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don‚Äôt think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It‚Äôs going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what‚Äôs going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other‚Äôs backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You‚Äôre all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who‚Äôs unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don‚Äôt be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it‚Äôll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who‚Äôs willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that‚Äôs awesome, but if you don‚Äôt just make sure you don‚Äôt take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I‚Äôll say this, I wasn‚Äôt going to go either, but something just told me ‚Äúfuck it, if there aren‚Äôt any then just go back home‚Äù, but I‚Äôm telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you‚Äôll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren‚Äôt able to secure a PS5, eventually you won‚Äôt be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don‚Äôt lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can‚Äôt believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you‚Äôre local weather!

What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5,"Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.


&amp;nbsp;

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",t2_civ38,1,"What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5 Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess."

If they revived an old favorite via sequel or remake for the new generation of consoles what would titles would get you genuinely excited?,"I absolutely love video games and although I would never really call myself a hard-core gamer, especially after having kids and very little time to devote to the hobby, I‚Äôve been around long enough to have my fair share of memorable video game moments.  

The soul crushing experience of beating Ghouls &amp; Ghosts only to find it demanding a second play through to officially beat the game...  Neighborhood friends leaning on my windowsill, mouth agape when we discovered the blood code for Mortal Kombat. My little brother and I picking our jaws up off of the floor when we experienced the first few minutes of Devil May Cry on our PS2 on Christmas morning having never experienced graphics like that on a console before. The two of us huddled under our covers absolutely terrified during a 2 AM session of resident evil or silent hill.

As I mentioned before, now that I‚Äôm a dad and don‚Äôt have nearly as much time to devote to playing video games as I would like. That said, as I look back, there are a few titles that I would collectively lose my shit over and make the time to play through if they happened to find their way onto the newest generation of consoles. 

**SSX Tricky**- The original and subsequent follow ups to the series definitely did a great job showcasing the capabilities of that generation of consoles however SSX Tricky brought the beautiful graphics head to head with incredibly satisfying and completely outrageous over the top game physics while adding its own unique brand of humor, customization, and addictive leveling system, all while stringing together ridiculous over the top superhuman trick combinations not seen since the days of Tony Hawk Pro skater. 

To see this title brought to the next generation of consoles with a graphical overhaul, and dear god just imagine what could be done with the haptic feedback of the new PS5 controllers. Imagine how addictively satisfying it would feel to push off a jump and feel the snap or pop of the board or literally feeling the powder crunch underfoot after landing a ridiculously sweet combo... there‚Äôs just so much potential hear it makes me a little crazy. 

**Oddworld: Strangers Wrath** - I can‚Äôt honestly remember how I stumbled across this game but it was one that I feel didn‚Äôt quite get the praise in attention it deserved. I could be wrong about this, perhaps that was just my perception, but I was left so satisfied after playing through this title. How seamlessly they were able to blend third person  3D platformer and first person shooter was just incredible. And the fact that you could almost play through the entire game using one or the other speaks volumes. The humor laced throughout, the creativity of ‚Äúlive ammunition‚Äú, and with a fantastic storyline to boot, this is one of those titles that genuinely left me sad upon completion as I just simply didn‚Äôt want it to end.

**Tiger Woods circa early-mid 2000s** - Damn was this title addictive. I know they are still pumping out titles but they are just not the same. No it wasn‚Äôt a ridiculously realistic golf simulator and that‚Äôs what made it great. The injection of and well balanced mix of arcade style gameplay and simulation, incredibly satisfying and addictive swing mechanics, silly customizations, and the genuinely hilarious in game commentary from David Feherdy &amp; Gary McCord made these titles so much damn fun. Nothing since has quite been able to capture the magic this series once had. They need to ease up on the simulation and inject a hint more of the arcade style shenanigans. Bring this series back to its glory days! Hell you didn‚Äôt even have to like golf to enjoy those games.

Just get a replacement. I've seen a lot of people worried, waiting for next year for PS5 just because of the viral launch issues from every console.

Who here is refugee from geforce now?,"After using gfn for nearly 3 years and having virtually all of my favourite games removed from the service - I am coming to ps5 so I have more actual ownership of my games. Gfn is a great service don't get me wrong and has given me access to a lot of my old steam games (having no suitable pc) but after having virtually all my fighting games removed along with all my racing games, enough is enough. Gfn plays perfectly well and gives reasonable graphics at 1080p, but it's not without its faults. Small amounts of lag, sub par rigs for certain games - these are all problems I am looking to overcome with getting a ps5. Finally I will be able to buy a game, knowing it won't be removed, play it without lag, and enjoy 4k.

I'm Worried the PS5 UI Will Launch With a Lot of Missing Features (Similar to PS3 and PS4) Your Thoughts?,"So if you all recall, the PS3 and especially PS4 user interfaces were lacking in a lot of features upon the launch of the respective consoles.

Sony knows that all these features and more are the kinds of things we expect from the start of a generation at this point. Since they're basically ""quid pro quo"" features for any good UI nowadays.

Basically, they were asking me my thoughts on VR, if I owned a PSVR, if I still play it, and why/why not.

Very interesting. Could Sony be thinking about opening game streaming to phones like Microsoft is doing? Or perhaps the next PSVR will be open and let you use it with other devices (phones, computers, tablets, etc)?

New studio acquisitions,"With Microsoft's 7.5 BILLION dollar purchase of Zenimax/Bethesda, I have seen a lot of articles and podcast talking about what studios Sony can buy in response. When I think about it, I would hope that if Sony has money stashed away for these type of acquisitions it would be better spent on creating new studios.
First off, a new studio would cost significantly less than buying established IP. Some of them are outlandish propositions people were putting out would have Sony buying Square Enix (valued around 6.8 billion) and even ubisoft (valued at 10.5 billion). Even if you consider a more realistic acquisition like From Soft(which is tied up under a much larger parent company) or Platinum, you are still talking about very expensive deals.
You could build new mid-sized (70 people) studios for approximately $25 - 35 million (salary + overhead) for the three to four years they would need to start self sustaining with revenue.
What if they started four of them!
They would come with the benefit of creating even more diversity that we would get to play.
I would be far less excited for them to buy an existing studio that already was planning on putting their games on PlayStation.
Just my two cents, but when I thought about that 7.5 billion dollar number, I immediately started thinking about how many new studios Microsoft could have created instead.",t2_1rvc66y,1,"New studio acquisitions With Microsoft's 7.5 BILLION dollar purchase of Zenimax/Bethesda, I have seen a lot of articles and podcast talking about what studios Sony can buy in response.

I am curious to see what new features are exclusive to the PS5 and what the graphics look like. Playing on a PS4 Pro, the alpha graphics looked like a mix of Perfect Dark Zero and the EA action game, Black. It just didn't look that good for a game that is coming out so close to 2021.

I hate to say it, but I don't even think some cool Dual Sense additions could even bump this game up higher than a 6 or 7 at the end of the day.

But with next gen being able to hit some pretty lofty visual targets. Might be a return of couch co-op, 2 camera views at 60fps but at maybe 1080p instead of 4k. Seems like a reasonable compromise.
I guess the only thing missing is the demand for such features in games.

Disappointing UK/PAL Box Art News: PS5 to KEEP the PS4 plain white text spine art for Sony games,"When we got box art for Miles Morales in PAL territories, we saw that it had a logo on the side, something that almost never happens for Sony first party pal games... Apart from Spiderman. It led many of us to hope that this would carry over to all next gen first party titles. We had also theorised that perhaps it was just for Spiderman so it would look similar to the first game's, as it appeared to be replicating the box art too.

Unfortunately, that is not the case (pun not intended). The box art for Sackboy has been revealed, and it has the cursed plain white text on it's spine

If you are wondering the meaning of this, [I made a more detailed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/iei649/a_european_uk_wish_for_ps5/) about this back when we got that news, complete with pics for non-PAL readers

But I'll give you a brief summary

* If you buy a PAL First party sony game, you get a generic white/black text on the spine of the box. This alone wouldn't be a problem, as the PS2 in Europe had it, and it's quite aesthetically pleasing. The problem is that it is ONLY Sony games with this, instead of everyone like for the PS2. This leaves your collection on your shelf looking like a collection of games, and pirated movies you bought in a foreign country on your vacation.

I was personally holding out hope for some change this generation, but it looks like I am going o have to look into the custom covers/slipcover community to fix this unfortunate reality

This is especially disappointing, as Sony promised a more global approach this generation, but this notion seems to have been just PR speak.

FAQs

&gt;I like the plain text on the PS2!

As do I, but it needs to be all or nothing. All logos, or all plain, it makes some look like lazy knock offs if they're alone

&gt;Why do you care so much?

As a physical owner, I like being able to look on a shelf and seeing the game's I've sunk many hours into. 99.99% of the time, I will finish a game, and then it will sit on the shelf. Is it that wrong to care for how a display piece looks?

&gt;Just use the alternate cover!

I would... if we got those. Most PAL territories get health warnings on the inside cover instead of the reversible covers found on Spiderman and God of War

&gt;Just Print out the US one!

Also not an option, as Sony doesn't put these scans up for Piracy reasons, meaning that if you get one it's a user's own scan, which are far from a good quality. Or you have to import an empty case, which starts to stack up as a costly endeavour if you're replacing a dozen first party games

&gt;First World problem much?

You're right, but Gaming is a first world pastime. If I am spending as much as I am on a game, it's not unreasonable to have packaging that looks good.

"Jason Schreier says FFXVI has been in development for ""at least 4 years"" and will release sooner than people think","This comment came in Schreier's most recent podcast episode. You can [find the episode here](https://player.fm/series/triple-click/whoa-microsoft-bought-bethesda), and this comment comes at 9:50. Schreier is a well-connected insider who has broken countless industry stories, so his information carries a bit more weight to me than most ""insider"" knowledge.

However, it's important to remember that the team behind FFXVI is a completely different team from those games.

You can [find the episode here](https://player.fm/series/triple-click/whoa-microsoft-bought-bethesda), and this comment comes at 9:50. Schreier is a well-connected insider who has broken countless industry stories, so his information carries a bit more weight to me than most ""insider"" knowledge.

"Sony's PS5 ""Gamer Feel"" + Wipeout 4, Motorstorm, Knack 3, The Order?","**From** PS1 to PS4, Sony have been there for us as gamers. From the feel-good moments  (""$299!"") &amp; the success taking on the Nintendo 64 &amp; Sega Saturn Juggernauts, Sony started strong.

By the time the PS3 had really hit its stride, with fantastic first party studio acquisitions and partnerships like Naughty Dog, From Software, and Media Molecule, I've always felt that despite owning multiple consoles &amp; PCs, Sony earnt my loyalty.

There have been some tough moments on PS4 (lacking wishlists, playtime, easy internal media storage, and no backwards compatibility through emulation of our PS1/PS2 collections, among others) but we've always been able to count on Sony to treat us like gamers and not insult the value of our time, bringing us first-party experiences like no other, and sharing it with PC &amp; other console brethren when possible. **So thank you Sony**, for bringing up welling excitement with the PS5 like never  before.

**To the point of this post**. There are a few franchises which are difficult to imagine life without, however it feels like too long already. Sony, can you bring us these, in some form or another? Or will they forever languish, lost to competing interests or past memories?

\-**Wipeout Series**. On all Sony consoles, there has been that reliable ultra-fast anti-grav racing experience. The thrill of modern hard electronica thudding through our brains, whilst the blood heats in our veins, has been a fantastic thing to enjoy since the one I began with, Wipeout 2097 (XL for NTSC partiers). It furthered a lifelong love of sensory overload and thumping breaks/d&amp;b. Will it come to PS5? Every month without an announcement is torturous, and surely others feel the same.

\-**Motorstorm Series**. More metal &amp; grunge than anything, and channelling Road Rash, Twisted Metal, and Carmageddon all at the same time, again with the aural overload that brings home the bass. As an Aussie, the locales often dug deep into that need to explore the unknown, and one misses it every day since a very first 720p game on the Fat PS3.

\-**Knack 3**. As someone who likes to look nothing up about games before immersing myself in the world, and after finishing the first knack with a partner, and finally getting around to the second most recently, it was very surprising to learn that the first was moderately well-received, and the second just so slightly more. No other game series, as someone who grew up in the '90s, has been able to put such a feeling of wondrous youth and excitement as an adult. 

**Knack 1 &amp; 2 were** **that** **feeling** of waking up at 5 am, sneaking into the TV room with a blanket, and watching Saturday morning cartoons - but this time, as an adult, with a significant other! That feeling is priceless, in a world where many have lost their ""wonder &amp; magic"" feelings to the prey of a quick, endlessly unsatisfying slot machine-type loop. 

\-**The Order: 1886**. This was a wonderfully cerebral take on the most detailed steampunk city that I've witnessed. The story was gripping, the combat was thrilling, and of course, there was no sequel or mention, after the mediocre reviews ripped it apart for being ""boring, unambitious, not next-gen, a glorified walking simulator"". I am sad to think that this franchise isn't given wings (or perhaps the figurative wings it has been given are the wrong ones?).

\-**PT.** Please. Make it so. The masses have spoken.

So, In conclusion to this essay-length feature, for anyone that made it this far, is a request to SIE to keep valuing our intelligence, and especially those of us that don't have the money but spend it anyway, because we continue to trust in your expertise as gamers and successful innovators.

And to developers that work with Sony: keep producing wonderful works. Resist the temptation to fall prey to companies who have a history of buying and running talented studios into the ground. Push back when the execs tell you that it's not a winning proposition, despite the rich history and worlds you've built. Don't take the easy monetization route, or one that compromises your ability to reach us Single-player experience-based gamers, because in this day and age, when some of us desperately need another world to be transported away to, we don't want to worry whether that world will be there for us in the future.

A Case for Remakes.,"I don't know if I am in the minority here, but I am loving this new boom of video game remakes. Sure, it can be seen as lazy to just give an old game a new can of paint and sell it off to us for nostalgia reasons, but I'm actually excited about that.

As a movie buff, I am always interested in remakes, seeing how a different director puts his vision into a known project. I guess the same thing pertains to games. I want to see how my old favorites would look with modern graphics. Plus, with recent remakes, they feel like entirely new games (FF7 remake), despite being the same subject material.

So, are there any old games you'd love to see remade? I'd love to see Dead Space make a return. Although looking at it now, the lighting is ahead of its time by a mile, it would be nice to see it with crazy graphics. And the 3D sound? Mah Gahd. Also, next gen damage models for the nechromorphs would look beautiful. And maybe F.E.A.R.? Maybe I just want a resurgence in action horror.",t2_jl8tb,1,"A Case for Remakes.

Sony can and should offer PS5 enhanced versions of PS4 games for free like microsoft.,"Microsoft lets you buy a copy of grand theft auto 4 13 years ago and still support it on their next generation hardware. Sony can't even make a enhanced version of spiderman ps4 free to current owners. This is the same BS in my opinion as offering ps3 classics you have to pay for rather than allowing you to get them free if you already own then on the ps3.

I'm just wondering what others in this community think about this.


Edit: ok so GTA IV was a bad example (but a fantastic game, pls be on ps5), basically my point was that CDPR, ubisoft, microsoft and a few others have said that the next generation version, as in the entire updated/enhanced game will be available to current owners for free.
These games are going to be a goodwill to consumers who are early adopters to new platforms and will hopefully be available years into the generation.

Sony is ""remastering"" a 2 year old game rather than providing a substantial update, this is a ploy to get people to buy it twice, they are clearly not trying to bolster sales to people who do not own it because it's only available as a collectors edition on top of the sequel.

Expanding Your PS5 Drive Space? Note That NVMe Drives Must Be Whitelisted by Sony,"I‚Äôm seeing a lot of chatter after Microsoft released their SSD expansion drive ($220!!!!). That‚Äôs honestly a lot of money. However, I‚Äôm seeing a lot of response from people saying that thank goodness PS5 will take any NVMe drive which can have prices anywhere from $50 to hundreds of dollars depending on size. 

However, you need to note that Sony must [whitelist the SSD drive](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/which-ssd-drives-will-be-compatible-with-ps5)

You can‚Äôt use any NVMe drive, so please don‚Äôt buy a cheap one you found online thinking it‚Äôll work. I don‚Äôt believe anything has been officially whitelisted by Sony yet.

Note that it‚Äôs $229 for 1TB. The cost of super fast load times and world loading is expensive. At least for now. *So I just wanted to warn people and inform people to just wait for a bit until we get official confirmation from Sony on which drives will work. And brace yourself on price. Maybe they‚Äôll be $229, maybe they‚Äôll be less, but they definitely won‚Äôt be cheap. Don‚Äôt buy a NVMe drive until we get confirmation that it‚Äôll work in the system.*

Edit: There‚Äôs some discussion of semantics on what ‚Äúwhitelisting‚Äù means in this article. It‚Äôs beside the point.

I already have Razer Kraken Essential, while I don't think they're bad, I'd prefer something more ""audiophile"". Bought Sony's wh-ch700n - returned them, the sound quality was mediocre IMO, also they are clearly designed for smartphones.

I know that gaming headsets are not known for their excellent sound quality, so I was leaning towards something without a mic, like Philips SPH5900 or ATH-M40X. Unfortunately, the first one is not available in my country, the second one seems to have mixed reviews."

Who else wishes for Sony to have diverse genre of games instead of just story driven third person games?,"As great the story driven games of PS4 are, I wish there were more variety in first party lineup. The games are getting more samey and I am sure I'd eventually get bored of them just like I got bored of Assassins Creed Series and Gears series.

There are no first party multiplayer heavy FPS game, similar to Halo. 

No RPG like BOTW. The only good open world first person RPG Elder Scrolls is supposedly not coming to PS5 and Avowed is the only game that seems to be falling under the same category, which is also again not coming to PS5.

There are no first party arcade racers or cart racers like Forza Horizon or Mario Kart.

 There are no 2D platforming like Ori or Donkey Kong. 

No turn based strategy game like Mario Rabbid or Gears Tactics. 

No game to play and chill with friends, similar to Animals Crossing or Sea Of Thieves.

 No fighting game like Smash Bros or Killer Instinct.

 No RTS like Halo Wars or AoE.

What kind of game is missing from Sony‚Äôs first party lineup of games?,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the games Sony has in the oven ready to go over the next few years. They have a really wide variety of incredibly successful franchises and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a lot of worry about whether the PS5 will struggle to find enough titles that by themselves will sell consoles. But where‚Äôs their weakness? What genre is leaving the biggest hole in Sony Studios first party lineup?

There are a few areas I think Sony could stand to invest in. First, is a military shooter. Maybe not first person, but something heavily combat focused with multiplayer potential. I‚Äôm sure the Crist thought goes right to SOCOM, as it should. People have been asking for a reboot for a while now and it‚Äôs for good reason. SOCOM was a tight, tactical shooter that gave many players their first taste of online multiplayer. It would do well with a reboot and could solidify the PS5 as the complete console package. 

The second area Sony should look into is a bit ambitious. But a 100+ hour open world game like The Witcher or Red Dead or even Assassin‚Äôs Creed would be something gamers could find themselves buying a console just to play. What I mean by this is a huge open world game that keeps players invested in the world and experiences long after the main story is complete. Sony has explored open world style games with Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, and most recently with Ghost of Tushima. This has extra implication because Xbox has the Bethesda, the undisputed king of making open world epics. 

Finally, Sony needs a sci-fi game. I don‚Äôt really know where on the spectrum of sci-s game needs to fall but with Killzone on the shelf collecting dust something needs to take its place. An argument could be made that Horizon meets the sci-fi criteria but I‚Äôm looking more in the realm of aliens, space ships, and energy weapons. It‚Äôs a hard genre to perfect but when you do it right it has lasting potential in the world of gaming. I think Sony could see this lasting potential turn into a large adoption of consoles.",t2_3uytk4eq,1,"What kind of game is missing from Sony‚Äôs first party lineup of games?

How to improve PS Now?,"While PS Now has more than enough titles to be played, the majority of games have to be streamed. Only certain PS4 and surprisingly PS2 titles can be downloaded. There is no way to emulate PS3 games. Streaming games requires a very strong internet connection, preferably a wired connection or 5ghz wireless. However, the quality of streamed games via PS Now isn't up to the quality compared to other cloud based services (e.g. GeForce Now). How could Sony make the service much more appealing to costumers? Here are some points that i think would greatly enhance the service:

1. **Make PS Now a software based full backwards compatibility solution:**

\- Bring back the game catalog of PS1 classics and expand the games we have on PS Now

\- Make it possible to emulate PS3 games  (maybe the PS5 could do it?) OR improve the streaming quality;

\- PSNow should be the ""game pass"" of older Playstation games

**2. Tie in the Playstation Store**

\- The PS4 can emulate PS2 games; why didnt we get the PS2 games we bought digitally back in the store? -&gt; apply this to PS1 games aswell

\- Games available on PSNow should be able to be bought through the PS Store (apply this for PS4 and PS5 users)

**3. PS Plus**

\- PSNow should be included in PS Plus OR in a PS Plus Premium subscription

\- Give away one month of PSNow (or PS Plus) whenever someone buys accessoires for their consoles (like controllers)

&amp;#x200B;

I really would like to see PS Now as a software solution to the missing full backwards compatibility we have on the PS5. Bring back PS1 and PS2 games into the PS Store, because there really is no reason to keep those games away from the store, when we can already see that the PS4 console can emulate PS2 games through PSNow. Also, if it can emulate PS2 games, it should also be able to emulate PS1 games easily. I admit PS3 games are tricky, and if the PS5 is not able to emulate PS3 games, then Sony should improve their cloud based gaming.

I had a dream...,"I had a dream that Sony would finally allows us to change the country of our PSN Account.

Jokes aside, Sony really needs to start working on this. Back when I created my US account Brazil wasn't even an option and then it took them 10 years to finally launch the store here (and with only a few games at first). 

The expensive dollar to reals right now and the overall economy makes it pretty difficult to buy stuff off my US account. I'd love to finally be able to buy stuff on my own currency.

Before anyone tell me to just create a new account I really don't want to. I have a whole life with my main US account, loads of games and DLCs, thousand of trophies and more than 100 friends.

Appreciation of future proofing,"With 49 days left to go I wanted to draw some attention to some of the benefits of an upgrade that aren‚Äôt necessarily game related. The quality of life stuff that as a launch PS4 owner are the biggest reasons I‚Äôm super amped for the next generation. Those being the NVME expandable storage, WiFi 6, and HDMI 2.1. All of those are yet to be ubiquitous, and while we may have a slightly weaker console it‚Äôs amazing that they packed years worth of upgrades in for the same cost as a competitor. 

WiFi 6 is still potentially limited for some things on PlayStation‚Äôs end, but with game streaming and digital downloads becoming more and more prevalent and gigabit internet becoming more common it‚Äôs awesome that we may see much higher throughput. 

NVME upgradeable internal storage is a HUGE win. Not being locked to a certain size or company could benefit us immensely in terms of cost in the long run. 

HDMI 2.1 is already here, though not super affordable yet. While I don‚Äôt see these consoles ever hitting 8K with some insane DLSS style magic 4K 120 already feels like a great late gen target for especially first party titles. 

Let me know if I‚Äôm out of line or missed something!

A story behind the new Flight Sim Japan Update trailer,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalJaTmv-TY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalJaTmv-TY)

A trailer for Flight Sim Japan Update was re-uploaded a few hours ago to celebrate its launch and to reflect some feedback regarding a political controversy.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima\_Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima_Island)

In the original video released during TGS, there was a scene with Hashima Island, a.k.a ""*Warship* Island"", a small island that were originally developed as a coal mine. During WWII, the island became a sort of 'labor camp', as Korean and Chinese civilians and prisoners were sent to the island to work at the mine under very harsh condition. 

After the initial trailer was uploaded, people immediately complained about the place being introduced as a 'beautiful scenery'. As exotic and beautiful as it may appear from the sky above, it represents a painful war memory for the survivors from the labor camp that are still alive to this day.

Microsoft told South Korean media 5 days ago that they were sorry and the trailer would be updated to remove the scene. [https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=110559](https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=110559) (a link for a Korean news article)

Most underrated game.,"What in your   most underrated game you really enjoyed, but just went under most people's radar.

Mines the 2010 reboot of medal of honor.

It's a solid shooter, really good helicopter gunship missions,good graphics at the time. But it's real strength was the story,  it's your typical special forces taking on the enemy in there country, what made it stand out is at the time of release Al-Qaeda were doing some seriously bad stuff,  the western forces were over there hunting them down, the games plot was so close to the real life situation that it added a lot of weight and context to the game. I remember thinking it was almost too closely mirroring some bad stuff going on at the time.",t2_jfa10b9,0,"Most underrated game.

Cant adjust spotify volume anymore?,"Before i used to be able to better adjust my spotify volume from the mobile app because some point in time last year xbox increased the volume by a large margin. I used to listen to spotify at 15% volume then last year xbox made it where even 5% was louder than the 15% volume so i used the app for the extra control.

Does this mean my XOne X is broken?,"I was playing theHunter, and suddenly my screen went to black, and then showed I've no signal. I tried all the common things like hard reset (holding the power + eject buttons for 10 seconds, switching HDMI cables, TV's, nothing worked)

The thing is Im planning to buy both PS5 and Xbox, need to change my phone, so it‚Äôs a a lot of fucking money. Ideally I wanted to spend 500-600 bucks at most for a 4KTV 50-60‚Äù. 

I assume true 120Hz is out of the question at that price range? However I can probably deal with 60Hz for now, as most games wont be 120Hz before midgen refresh.

Questions for those that have played NBA 2K21 or Madden 21?,"I've been debating on buying the new Madden and NBA games, but everything I read says they are horrible. For those that have played, are they really that bad? Is it just a copy and paste of last year's editions or have they gotten worse?

For 2k, I know the shot stick has changed drastically, but how bad is this game? I looked up user reviews and read generally horrid reviews with an average rating of about 1.5/5.

I still enjoy playing NBA 2K20 (my career/my league) mostly, but am wondering if I am better off just sticking to 20 until patches come out and the rookie class is added. 

As for Madden, I'm hesitant because nothing I've seen looks any different from last year. I've seen countless glitch plays instead of highlights and the field mode, while exciting, wouldn't compel me to purchase it for solely that mode.

I recently bought a second xbox one so our kids could play one each.  They are too far away physically to talk to each other, I was wondering how to get the voice chat working between them.

Fable 3 co op,"So I just recently downloaded Fable 3 onto my Xbox one to start playing again. I had progressed through the story up until I have to meet Ben Finn outside the Bowerstone Castle. My friend decided he wanted to play as well, so we made him an account and progressed him to about Brightwood. I jumped in to his account with my own separate profile (Outside Bowerstone Castle) but then I had left the session without signing out or turning off my controller. Once he had gone into the Reliquary it had auto saved, but it didn‚Äôt make either one of us think twice. He said he wanted me to join, so I did (again). This time I joined as an exact copy of him (in Dweller gear and only 23 Guild Seals). I was extremely confused and went to load my Bowerstone Castle save only to see it overwritten? I can‚Äôt load it because it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm on. 
I ended the session and logged into my game only to be right where we logged him out and I‚Äôm still his exact copy.

Question about controller faceplates,"So I have a scuf infinity that I bought a few years ago that needs a new faceplate. From what I gather they just took a model 1697 xbone controller and added the paddles to the back. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a (somewhat decent and not sketchy) replacement faceplate for that model. I DO however see a lot of good replacement faceplates for the 1698 model, which is the original elite controller. I know that there is the hole for the profile switch in the middle, but besides that, would that faceplate work on a 1697 controller?

I know there are discrepancies like not being able to use the ‚Äúscuf rings‚Äù to hotswap the thumb sticks (which I don‚Äôt even have on the right as it blocks my kontrol freek) and the hole in the middle, but as long as I can screw it in and it will be a compatible fit I will be happy. I just don‚Äôt feel like spending $170 on a series 2 controller because of the faceplate (especially considering i copped 2 series x‚Äôs for me and family). And I‚Äôve taken apart the controller many times and also replaced the bumpers, so I‚Äôm trying to squeeze all the life out of this one first lol.

There are some occasional big games added to the library and majority of the users seem to be waiting only for those. And this seriously raises doubts about the value for money aspect with these subscription models. 

I really love the monthly free games offered on PlayStation Plus because for most months, they do give decent games. But this subscription model just doesn‚Äôt seem to click with me."

"It seems that playing video games early has a great positive effect onto your memory, says this neuroscience study. So ready for the PS5?","While a number of studies have shown that video games can cause structural or functional changes in the brain, including the activation of areas responsible for attention or spatial and visual skills, this new work reveals lasting beneficial effects on memory when practiced in childhood.

Sony should add Google Drive/Dropbox backup for screenshots and videos on PS5,"It would help a lot if we could backup screenshots and videos to Google Drive or Dropbox so it is easier to grab them on our PCs/smartphones. On PS4 we either need to have a USB drive in hand or we send screenshots (one by one) as a message to a dummy account.  The only alteranative for videos is sending them to Youtube and download them later.

I hope Sony allows us to link our Google or Dropbox accounts on PS5 so we can make auto/manual backups. It will probably take a long time but I hope they at least consider it throughout PS5 lifecycle.

Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013. What do you guys think how PS5 will perform throughout its life cycle?,"So this is more of a technical discussion I guess. I've been thinking a bit about the PS4 lately in an effort to understand how the PS5s life cycle may play out.

And basically three major questions have emerged:

1. was the PS4 really underpowered when it launched?

2. How come resolution and framerate didn't really get worse throughout its life cycle even as games became more visually impressive?

3. What does that mean for PS5?

I'd like to give my own two cents on this but I'm very curious to hear your takes on this since I most propably missed some stuff.

Was the PS4 underpowered? Looking back at 2013 I don't actually think it was. But the specs were certainly less impressive than PS5 today. Everyone (me included) constantly trashes PS4s CPU but at launch it was propably somewhere around Intel i3. Not too bad. The 1.84tf wasn't too bad either. Definitely not high end but still mid range. The 8gb of DDR5 on the other hand were really impressive. This was during a time when we were debating wether you needed 2gb of video RAM. All in all I'd say PS4 was a mid range system compared to PS5 which sits in the higher mid range.

So why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time? Especially during the Xbox360/PS3 era there was a clear trend towards games performing worse later in the generation. In 2006/7 you'd actually see some 720p 60fps AAA titles. Later on it was more like 540p25fps.

This didn't really happen for PS4 though and I don't really have an answer for that. At launch most PS4 games were ~900p 30fps and I can't say it has gotten much worse over time. In fact during 2015 I'd say performance actually got better with lots of games hitting 1080p30fps or 900p60fps. I don't really have an answer for this one since PS4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required years of experience to unlock its power. My guess is that games didn't get that much more demanding with PC gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals (judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example). This generation didn't really have a Crysis that completely blew away the status quo.

Now to my final question. What does that mean for PS5? While PS5 is more powerful than PS4 was back in the day I'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot.

If the life cycle does in fact turn out similarly to PS5 I think the status quo will be 4K 60fps without ray tracing and 30fps with ray tracing. However the UE5 demo from this summer tells a different story. It was super impressive but only ran at 1440p 30fps. I could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding. In that case I think it is absolutely crucial that PS5 has a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low res image to something that at least resembles 4K resolution. Otherwise I fear we will see the issue where lots of games will be ""dynamic 4K 30fps"" but will dip wayy below 4K most of the time, resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a 4K display.

What do you guys think about this? Did I miss something? Did I get something wrong? What's your take on PS4s performance throughout its life cycle and how do you anticipate PS5 will compare?",t2_5p6btf8r,1,"Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013.

Rise Gamers! Turkish Gamers are in a very bad situation. Please help us to get regional pricing,"Hi. Let me get straight to the point. I am asking for the help of all gamers around the world so Turkish Playstation users can also enjoy the great exclusives you guys do.  
  
Playstation Turkey recently increased the prices of some games to enormous amounts. For example, the new Avengers game costs 679 Turkish liras (87 US $) or Need for Speed Heat costs 709 Turkish liras (91 US $). So with these prices, we can only buy 3 games if we save all of our monthly minimum wage (2.324 Turkish liras). Let me also add that lots of people in Turkey earn a minimum wage because there is a  lack of jobs, even people who graduate from universities could end up in a minimum wage job which is not enough for anything.   
  
Let me also add that, this economical situation of our country is of course not the problem of Sony. We are also people just like you, I may or not support this goverment but I have the right to enjoy games as much as other people from other contries do. Just because I am born in this country, should not mean that I should not enjoy the things that you guys do. Other companies help with their pricing so we can also play games but Sony does not. For example 20$ indie games cost around 32 Turkish Liras on Steam so we can also enjoy them. Another example for Steam could be Cyberpunk 2077 costing 249 turkish liras. With these pricing examples, we can afford them by saving money for a few weeks/months. Microsoft also offers us Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for 45 Turkish Liras a month so we can enjoy as much as you guys do.  
  
But when it comes to Sony, they don't do anything. I also want to enjoy the new upcoming God of War Ragnarok or the new Demon's Souls but at this rate they are going to cost 800-900 turkish liras which is far from affordable. And even worse the PS5 is probably going to cost arond 8000 Turkish Liras (1020 US$) because of the heavy taxes of our country.  
  
What I am asking from Sony is to give Turkish players a regional pricing. If they don't want this because of the abuse that other gamers from other countries can do (buying from us because its cheaper) they could make it so that only people with Turkish ID's would be able to buy from the Turkish store.  
  
And from you guys and girls, from you fellow Gamers. I am asking for your support. Please support us so we can also enjoy that new God of War game, even that cute Bugsnax game together. I don't want to be forced to wait for the hope of getting these new games on ps plus when they come to that service 4 years later.

PS.: Before you envy us for still being able to buy both consoles on launch day, take into consideration the fact we have one  of the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most expensive consoles‚Äù, at R$4.999, which is close to double the $499 US price, due to insane import taxes. Most Brazilians will end up buying those consoles in the grey market after launch, imported through Paraguai or the US."

I finally played Gears 5 while I was home sick.,"I finished Gears 5's campaign today and I justed needed to say that whether or not I go the Xbox Series X or PS5 route (still undecided) I had a blast.  

I've been with the franchise since the start. I even grew up in the city where it was developed (I had a signed copy of Gears of War 3 back home as well, from a midnight release where some developers were doing a signing at a local Gamestop).  Gears of War was the co-op shooter my friends and I played in between Halo releases. We would go through the campaign at scheduled times so no one got left behind and when we beat the story we would play endless rounds of horde and try and beat wave 50 on each map, some nights we were up until 3 am (for reference I was 17 in highschool when 3 came out).  

When Gears of War 4 came out I was excited to get back on and clear it with my friends, but unfortunately they had all grown tired of the series. So me and my younger beat it together and I stuck around for a bit of multiplayer and horde for a bit, no where near as much as 2 or 3.  It was the ultimate experience I had when I was a kid but I appreciated my brother tagging along even if he had no investment to the story or anything. 

So by the time Gears 5 came out I was hesitant to play it, since my brother now lives in a different time zone and doesn't play online as much anymore either.  I had Game pass so I downloaded it. Got in a match of horde just see how it looked and felt. Yup felt like Gears alright.  Then I played the story and stopped about halfway through the second act.  I just wasn't feeling it.  And I pretty much put it out of my mind all together. 

Then this weekend I got a mild cold and couldn't work the last few days.  I figured I could use some action and melodrama so I decided to boot up Gears 5 and sink my teeth in.

I beat it in less then a couple days but what a ride. The story was pretty good honestly, I didn't really appreciate swapping protagonists after only one game in the new trilogy but I ended up preferring Kait over JD overall, she's just something different for the series and her motivation was interesting enough to get me hooked. 

Now while I liked the story, I loved the moments of sheer spectacle.  There were times when I would drop my jaw when I certain scene would happen.  I haven't felt so tiny in a videogame since Halo 2 verses the Scarab.  And I wasn't just tiny, I was the scrappy Outsider on a mission. I was pretty immersed I'd say.  The visuals and sound design, just outstanding. 

But the gameplay, the most I've ever clicked in a Gears of War game.  Using Jack's abilities allowed me to change it up and figure out new tactics.  There were so many hairpin moments where one shot and one second decided whether or not I was going to be a splatter on the screen, and when I pulled it off, just fantastic.  Or when I was using the GL Lancer and managed to get 4-5 drones in one shot during an intense fight. So satisfying.  And that's the other thing every firefight was tense and after each one it only ramped up and up.  Oh and the boss fight in act 2, I died countless times but eventually when I overcame it I got that sigh of relief that I honestly haven't had with a game for a while.  This game made me feel like a kid again going, ""what the fuck?!"" like I did when I was in highschool with my friends. 

I didn't care too much for the open world. I liked the side objectives alright, nothing memorable, the component parts kept me checking every nook and cranny, and the skiff when it got up to speed was really fun to drive, but it felt too empty and padding to validate it being there.  You could've kept the linear level design and maybe had an optional side mission you could either ignore or do along the route and it'll bring you back to where you were, but I guess they were just following trends or something.  

I gotta say I didn't expect to write a full review like this before 10pm, but I was just surprised how much I actually enjoyed this game.  I look back on the series fondly but when I'm away from it I usually just think of it as ""The big dudes shoot at the ugly dude behind a well placed wall"" and kinda just write it off.  But when I'm actually playing it, I get it.  It is definitely just like I described but it's got more to it then I remembered and I'm glad I got this cold so I could play it.  Whether or not I stick with Xbox or not this was a good game to finish this generation on.

We would go through the campaign at scheduled times so no one got left behind and when we beat the story we would play endless rounds of horde and try and beat wave 50 on each map, some nights we were up until 3 am (for reference I was 17 in highschool when 3 came out).  

When Gears of War 4 came out I was excited to get back on and clear it with my friends, but unfortunately they had all grown tired of the series. So me and my younger beat it together and I stuck around for a bit of multiplayer and horde for a bit, no where near as much as 2 or 3.  It was the ultimate experience I had when I was a kid but I appreciated my brother tagging along even if he had no investment to the story or anything. 

So by the time Gears 5 came out I was hesitant to play it, since my brother now lives in a different time zone and doesn't play online as much anymore either.  I had Game pass so I downloaded it. Got in a match of horde just see how it looked and felt. Yup felt like Gears alright.  Then I played the story and stopped about halfway through the second act.  I just wasn't feeling it.  And I pretty much put it out of my mind all together. 

Then this weekend I got a mild cold and couldn't work the last few days.  I figured I could use some action and melodrama so I decided to boot up Gears 5 and sink my teeth in.

I beat it in less then a couple days but what a ride. The story was pretty good honestly, I didn't really appreciate swapping protagonists after only one game in the new trilogy but I ended up preferring Kait over JD overall, she's just something different for the series and her motivation was interesting enough to get me hooked. 

Now while I liked the story, I loved the moments of sheer spectacle.  There were times when I would drop my jaw when I certain scene would happen.  I haven't felt so tiny in a videogame since Halo 2 verses the Scarab.  And I wasn't just tiny, I was the scrappy Outsider on a mission. I was pretty immersed I'd say.  The visuals and sound design, just outstanding. 

But the gameplay, the most I've ever clicked in a Gears of War game.  Using Jack's abilities allowed me to change it up and figure out new tactics.  There were so many hairpin moments where one shot and one second decided whether or not I was going to be a splatter on the screen, and when I pulled it off, just fantastic.  Or when I was using the GL Lancer and managed to get 4-5 drones in one shot during an intense fight. So satisfying.  And that's the other thing every firefight was tense and after each one it only ramped up and up.  Oh and the boss fight in act 2, I died countless times but eventually when I overcame it I got that sigh of relief that I honestly haven't had with a game for a while.  This game made me feel like a kid again going, ""what the fuck?!"" like I did when I was in highschool with my friends. 

I didn't care too much for the open world. I liked the side objectives alright, nothing memorable, the component parts kept me checking every nook and cranny, and the skiff when it got up to speed was really fun to drive, but it felt too empty and padding to validate it being there.  You could've kept the linear level design and maybe had an optional side mission you could either ignore or do along the route and it'll bring you back to where you were, but I guess they were just following trends or something.  

I gotta say I didn't expect to write a full review like this before 10pm, but I was just surprised how much I actually enjoyed this game.  I look back on the series fondly but when I'm away from it I usually just think of it as ""The big dudes shoot at the ugly dude behind a well placed wall"" and kinda just write it off.  But when I'm actually playing it, I get it.  It is definitely just like I described but it's got more to it then I remembered and I'm glad I got this cold so I could play it.  Whether or not I stick with Xbox or not this was a good game to finish this generation on.

Edit: I wrote this on mobile and now my thumbs are sore..."

Speaker Recommendations?,"Hey all, 

So, maybe not the totally best place to ask this, but I figured I'd go for it anyway. 

I have my 1X setup in my home office connected to a Samsung 4K monitor. I'm looking for suggestions on how to improve my audio quality.  If I'm playing a multiplayer game, I use an Astro A10 headset. If I'm playing offline single player games, I have a pretty basic Logitech speaker set I picked up at Best Buy several years ago. 

Keeping things simple and without breaking the bank too badly (say \~$100) what would you recommend?

When I download the game when it releases on my new Series X, will I be able to download it through my account on the One X so she can play, or is the Series X version a different download?

Basically, will I have to buy the game for the Series X and for the One X in order for us to play together, or will the gameshare option still work?

Can't play Destiny 2 on same network with other Xbox,"Been tearing my hair out over this issue reading countless forum and reddit posts, trying all suggestions without success and I'm about at my limit.

Hardware:

Modem: Arris SB8200

Router: Netgear Nighthawk AC1750 (R6700v3)

Xbox One X (x2)


The problem:

My room mate and I can play together just the two of us in a fireteam for hours without issue, but if we bring a friend into the fireteam and attempt to do an activity, one of us will get booted, every time.

Some other interesting details present are:

- In the Xbox friends list, I appear offline to him even though I'm not set to Appear Offline.

- Given the above, if he sends me an invite to anything, I won't get it, but, I can send him invites, and he does get it.


What I've tried:

- Automatic IPs, UPnP enabled = can't play at all without being disconnected almost immediately with a wide assortment of Bungie error codes (beaver, eel, etc)

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled = same result

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled, + putting one Xbox in DMZ = same result

- Static IPs, UPnP enabled + IPv6 enabled = we can play without issue


At this stage, I should mention, within the Xbox Advanced Network settings, we both have Open NATs, differently assigned port numbers, and show IPv4 &amp; IPv6 in use.


Now, when we attempt playing with others in the fireteam, my NAT remains Open while the other Xbox gets a Moderate NAT (and as mentioned, one of us will get booted after starting an activity).


To try and solve this, I tried:

- Disabling UPnP, reset router, Re-enabling UPnP, reset router again, then reset modem, and both Xbox's = same issue

- Disabling UPnP, enable port forwarding for ports 88, 500, 3074, 3544, and 4500 on one system, and 89, 501, 3075, 3544, and 4501 on the other, reset everything like above = same result


This should NOT be necessary at all to get two systems working.  Almost every help topic I come across about this mentions how Bungie is a clueless pos when it comes to networking so, I'm confident it IS on their end (and maybe some of XBL too given what I mentioned about appearing offline and invites not working), but, clearly some people can make it work with all these fixes, and others make it work with no configuration at all.


Things I've not tried yet:

- Getting a 2nd IP from Comcast (from what I understand this should definitively fix the issue)

- Getting a different router


I'm not sure a 2nd IP is available to me, that's something I need to call about, but if it's not available then...

As for another router, what I'd love to know is, for those with multiple Xbox's who play Destiny 2 together without any extra configuration, what is the router that you're using?  I want it.

"Good news for external HDD users, great news for external SSD users.","[https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1310571820999823362?s=20](https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1310571820999823362?s=20)

The load times for legacy games off a USB SSD are nearly on par with loading off the internal NVMe SSD.  It's *under a second* difference when loading Assassin's Creed Origins.   This shows that backwards compatible games don't need to be taking up valuable internal space to be played with the really quick loads.

&amp;#x200B;

Why isn't there much difference between the internal SSD and an external SSD?  It's probably because the processing of data off the drive is the real bottleneck.

Xbox One X shutting itself down.,"Help! My Xbox One X keeps shutting down on its own, for about the last week it has been shutting off while either searching for a match in COD or Apex, OR it shuts down right when a match ends of Rainbow Six Siege or Halo MCC.  

This does NOT appear to be an overheating issue as the console is barely warm, definitely not hot. It‚Äôs in an open area with good air flow, I‚Äôve tried plugging in back in and removing the power cable, I did a factory reset, reinstalled games, switched from wires to wireless network, and took it apart to clean it. Nothing seems to do the trick.  My warranty is expired and it would cost $250 to replace so I‚Äôm not going to do that with the new consoles coming out.

Xbox One Recordings: It is a case of luck,"Hi Guys,

I believe that there are dozens of posts about this but all of them suggests the same full power reset which doesn't always solve the problem.

The biggest disappointment with my current Xbox One X even with S is when you have that awesome kill, hit record, go check it later and all you have is a 6s video. The same applies to external storage which enables 1h recording.  
To try to avoid that, I always hit record like 2-4 times to make sure it will save.  


I believe I have tried everything:

* Full power reset. I always turn off/full power off the console, then turn off the wall socket - Australia power socket
* USB stick 3.0, good one
* External  Toshiba 128GB USB 3.0 mSATA  \~380MB/s
* External Silicon Power 1TB NVMe PCIe USB 3.0 storage which used to be my main storage and crazy fast loading. But the console would freak out sometimes which recently I discover it has to be an NGFF SATA so I went back to my WD 3TB USB 3.0 where all my games are stored and played from  \~480MB/s
* I've tried different USB ports from the console
* Even recording to the console which limits you to 2min, you end up with 6s videos.

I don't wanna spend thousands with captures devices, I am not a bloody YouTuber haha  
I don't wanna lose my 4K HDR TV either, the majority of the devices limit the output to 1080p

My recording setting is set to 1080p. I have even tried 720p before and still.

Is there anyone with an up to do date solution for this annoying issue?

Help me understand Ray Tracing (Spider-Man PS4 remastered) Honest question.," I'm not a pc gamer, so I'm not used to Ray Tracing. 

So from what I heard and know, Ray Tracing allow light to better reflects on surface and to create better reflection. (I can be wrong) 

And as you all know, today this photo of Spider-Man Ps4 remastered came to life. 

[https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv](https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv)

But I feel like there's something wrong.

With how high Peter is and that camera angle, is that normal to see all the street and the pedestrians below him? 

And also is Ray Tracing supposed to be ""like a mirror""? I mean is it supposed to have a 100% reflection of what is on the other side/angle? Is it too exaggerated in the photo or is this really what is Ray Tracing? 

I feel like this is just because it's the beggining of it on consoles so Devs doesn't have a standpoint (except on Pc)

I feel like this is just because it's the beggining of it on consoles so Devs doesn't have a standpoint (except on Pc)

First-Party Titles Run At 4K@30 or Dynamic 4K@60?,"So on the Spider-Man Remastered page, it says, [Link](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered/);

And experience swinging through New York and combat as an experienced Spider-Man with an optional performance mode that takes advantage of Insomniac‚Äôs temporal injection for dynamic 4K/60fps\*.

We have also been told that;

&gt;and the same optional performance mode offered on Marvel‚Äôs Spider-Man: Miles Morales, allowing you to finally play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate.

We also know that Demon's Souls, at least in the trailer, according to DF was rendering internally at 1440p and then upscaled to 4K so basically Dynamic 4K right?

Does this mean that in quality mode the games will run at 4K@30fps with ray-tracing and in performance mode, it will run in Dynamic 4K@60fps without downgrading graphical fidelity so raytracing still on?

Even if it is up to the dev, it seems that Miles Morales, Spider-Man Remastered, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Demon's Souls will have these 2 choices, they seem to be using Insomniac's Temporal Injection method,

&gt;which takes a lower internal resolution and uses prior/upcoming frames as well as AA to fill in the details to get a 4K image. It's another way of upscaling, like checkerboarding is, but temporal injection gives a cleaner image. Before DLSS 2.0 it was probably the best quality upscaling method.

The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue.,"""Fair warning. This is going to be weirder that usual.""

So hear me out. I have been paying attention to this Yakuza issue with ps4 saves not transferring to ps5 and it seems it may not be the only game having this problem and by ommission and assumptions it's gone unnoticed.

I have to think that the issue has to be a technical one. There's no way an rpg that is crossplay wouldn't want to be cross-save as well. That makes me nervous about other games like AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk that are also crossplay.

Control got heat for only allowing the Ultimate edition to upgrade, but what if they knew the older version's saves wouldn't transfer either. Also the Spider-man remaster won't allow save transfer as well. So that's three.

I am no tech guy and this may be the concerns of an overthinker, but it bares considering that saves may not be as easy to transfer from one system to the other this time.

It could explain the new crunch time situation at CDPR after they promised they wouldn't. If they hit a snag like this they would grind their way to a solution (or they just told people what they wanted to hear).",t2_1dbv0e0c,1,"The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue. ""Fair warning.

1440p 60fps is the way to go next gen,"Hear me out before keyboard warrioring please.

I've noticed a trend where 4K 60fps games as well as 4K 30fps games look like current gen visually(as in texture quality and the overall look of a game, not resolution). Examples of this are Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Godfall, Final Fantasy 16, Kena Bridge of spirits, Spider Man: Miles Morales and Halo Infinite. On the other hand you have very few games that genuinely look next gen. Like a handful at most. And one of these games is confirmed to run at 1440p(Demon Souls remake). Then you also have the unreal engine 5 tech demo(not a game but it still counts) which also runs at 1440p. The only other two I can think of is horizon forbidden west and black myth wukong. The former will probably be 4K 30fps knowing Sony but its going to be cross gen so a lot of power can be devoted to realistic graphics since its basically going to be an amped up version of a PS4 game. As for the latter, we do know that is 60fps and seems very unlikely to run at 4K on console judging by how advanced the graphics look compared to other next gen games. If games which look like PS4 games are bottlenecked at 4K 30 or 4K 60 there's no way in hell Black Myth Wukong can run 4K 60 so its most likely 1440p 60 like the tech demo and demon souls remake. 

Anyway, the bottom line is for a game to actually look like a genuine next gen game it has to be 1440p or sacrifice other areas like frame rate as well as being very limited in size which would be a huge turn off for some gamers such as myself who prioritise frame rate over resolution. 

1440p is a perfect compromise. 4K is a monolithic leap that is really unnecessary. Usually each gen the jump tends to be around 300p. PS1 to PS2 was 144p to 480p which is just over 300p. PS2 to PS3 was 480 to 720p which is a 240p jump. PS3 to PS4 was 720 to 1080p jump so 360p. If we go from 1080p to 1440p that would still be an above average leap at 360p difference. We all noticed the sharp resolution quality increase when we switched from 3 to 4 so why wouldn't the same happen with 1440p. 4K on the other hand is excessive. Why jump 1080 pixels all of a sudden? Not only is this uncalled for but like I said, it also sacrifices frame rate and ultimately weakens the graphical quality of games by using so much of the GPU's power so that the actual graphical quality of games look like last gen. 1440p 60fps is a much more well rounded solution that benefits everyone and is more beneficial towards both graphics and gameplay. Besides a needlessly large jump in resolution that people will get used to pretty quickly, there is nothing to lose from this.

Maybe they will preload the console itself?,"I'm thinking, maybe they'll start shipping the consoles a week earlier so that you can have your games downloaded and ready to play on the launch?

Before the launch, you won't be able to play the games anyway, because they won't be released yet. It'll only play PS4 games, so it won't really be early access.

Plus they don't want their servers dead because everyone's downloading games at the same time.

"I said ""fuck it"" and pulled the trigger on a one X today.","I have mainly gamed on a Switch and 3DS for the last few years. I had a ps4 but I honestly hate Sony's business ethics and I felt no connection to the first party games besides God of War. I wanted a newer system come next month. Me and my wife were able to secure a ps5 for my son and I was left in the dust. I couldn't get a hold of an Xbox series S or X, and no ps5.  I felt stupid for calling stores asking if they had any pre-orders left and when I was laughed at during a call it really sucked. 

I hate having a 1080p console on a 4k tv. It looks awful and unnatural. I wanted a new system that could hit true 4K. Sony's fake checkerboard crap wasn't going to cut it. I got a refurbished xbox one X with a one year warranty for $280. I figured that since Xbox was behind on 1st party support right now this could give me the time to play games like Far Cry 5 before jumping to the new gen. At least two years.
